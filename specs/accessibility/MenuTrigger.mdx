# MenuTrigger Accessibility Specification

## Overview

A `MenuTrigger` is a component that surrounds a trigger `Button` and either a `Menu` or a `Popover` that expands to display when the `Button` is clicked.

The trigger `Button` is often styled as a typical push button with a downward pointing arrow or triangle to hint that activating the button will display a menu.

## WAI-ARIA Design Pattern

The `MenuTrigger` component implements the [Menu Button design pattern, per WAI-ARIA 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#menubutton).

### Keyboard Interaction

With focus on the button:
 - <kbd>Enter</kbd>: opens the menu and places focus on the first menu item.
 - <kbd>Space</kbd>: Opens the menu and places focus on the first menu item.
 - (Optional) <kbd>ArrowDown</kbd>: opens the menu and moves focus to the first menu item.
 - (Optional) <kbd>ArrowUp</kbd>: opens the menu and moves focus to the last menu item. Note that v2, does not implement this behavior.

The keyboard behaviors needed after the menu is open are described in the [Menu Accessibility spec](Menu.mdx).

Note, that it is important for the `Button` component to have `type` equal to `button` so clicking a `MenuTrigger` button within a `form` does not submit the form.

### Roles, States, and Properties

- The element that opens the menu has role [`button`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#button). With a `<button>` element, role `button` will be implicit.
- The element with role `button` has [`aria-haspopup`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-haspopup) set to
  - `menu` or `true` if the popup is a [`menu`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#menu),
  - `listbox` if the popup is a [`listbox`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#listbox),
  - `tree` if the popup is a [`tree`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tree),
  - `grid` if the popup is a [`grid`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#grid), or
  - `dialog` if the popup is a [`dialog`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#dialog).
- When the popover is displayed, the element with role `button` has [`aria-expanded`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-expanded) set to `true`. When the popover is hidden, it is recommended that `aria-expanded` is not present. If `aria-expanded` is specified when the popover is hidden, it is set to `false`.
- The popover that displays by activating the button has a role [`menu`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#menu) or matching that declared using the `aria-haspopup` prop on the button.
- Optionally, the element with role `button` has a value specified for [`aria-controls`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-controls) that refers to the popover element with the role declared using the `aria-haspopup` by `id`.
- Additional roles, states, and properties needed for the `menu` element are described in the [Menu Accessibility spec](Menu.mdx).

## v2 Implementation details

In React Spectrum, `MenuTrigger` has been implemented as a [`Dropdown`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/Dropdown) or with [`DropdownButton`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/DropdownButton), which make use of [`OverlayTrigger`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/OverlayTrigger).

### longClick and holdAffordance

`OverlayTrigger` supports `longClick`, which expands the popover on mouse down after a 250ms delay, as an option for the `trigger` prop.
The `holdAffordance` boolean prop specifies the visual affordance for the `longClick` behavior on the trigger button.
In `DropdownButton`, setting `holdAffordance` to `true` automatically sets `longClick` as the `trigger` prop on the `OverlayTrigger`.
The keyboard combination <kbd>Alt + ArrowDown</kbd> will expand the popover with `longClick` as the `trigger`.
