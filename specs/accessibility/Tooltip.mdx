# Tooltip Accessibility Specification

## Overview

A [`Tooltip`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/Tooltip) appears when a user hovers, taps, or focuses on an element.
The information it displays is simple and concise. It can be the description
of an icon, a simple explanation of a behavior or help text.

## WAI-ARIA Design Pattern

The [`Tooltip`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/Tooltip) component implements the [Tooltip design pattern, per WAI-ARIA 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/#tooltip), which defines a tooltip as a popup that displays information related to an element when the element receives keyboard focus or the mouse hovers over it.
It typically appears after a small delay and disappears when <kbd>Escape</kbd> is pressed or on mouse out.

Tooltip widgets do not receive focus. A hover that contains focusable elements can be made using a [`Popover`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/Popover) as a non-modal dialog.

### Keyboard Interaction

<kbd>Escape</kbd>: Dismisses the tooltip.

#### NOTE:

1. Focus stays on the triggering element while the tooltip is displayed.
2. If the tooltip is invoked when the trigger element receives focus, then it is dismissed when it no longer has focus (`onBlur`). If the tooltip is invoked with `mouseIn`, then it is dismissed with `mouseOut`.

Tooltip should also comply with [WCAG 2.1 Success Criterion 1.4.13 Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#content-on-hover-or-focus) which states:
> Where receiving and then removing pointer hover or keyboard focus triggers additional content to become visible and then hidden, the following are true:
> * **Dismissable**: A mechanism is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus (e.g. the <kbd>Escape</kbd> key), unless the additional content communicates an [input error](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-input-error) or does not obscure or replace other content;
> * **Hoverable**: If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing. This can be verified in the [Tooltip
with OverlayTrigger: using hover and focus storybook example](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/storybook/?path=/story/tooltip--with-overlaytrigger-using-hover-and-focus);
> * **Persistent**: The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.
>
> Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author (e.g. the `title` attribute).

### Mobile

On touch devices:
- If the element that triggers the tooltip triggers some other action, tapping or clicking the element should execute the action without opening the tooltip.
- If the tooltip text is significant to the description of the element receiving input on mobile, the tooltip text should be explicitly concatenated to the element's accessibility name using the `aria-label` property.
- If the sole purpose of the element that triggers the tooltip is to provide a target for the tooltip (e.g. a "?" icon button indicating that additional information is available), use `['hover', 'focus', 'click']` as the `trigger` prop for the `OverlayTrigger` component that wraps the trigger element.

### Roles, States, and Properties

- The element that serves as the tooltip container has role [`tooltip`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#tooltip).
- The element that triggers the tooltip references the tooltip element with [`aria-describedby`](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-1.1/#aria-describedby).

## v2 Implementation details
`Tooltip` relys on the [`OverlayTrigger`](https://react-spectrum.corp.adobe.com/components/OverlayTrigger) component to control display of the `Tooltip` on keyboard focus or on hover.

When an `OverlayTrigger` opens an element with `role` equal to `tooltip`, an appropriate `aria-describedby` attribute will be added to the trigger element.

```jsx
<OverlayTrigger placement="right">
  <Button label="Tooltip" variant="cta" />
  <Tooltip variant="info">
    Displays a tooltip
  </Tooltip>
</OverlayTrigger>
```
