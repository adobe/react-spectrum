import {Asset} from '@react/react-spectrum/Asset';

A **Card** is a pattern that is commonly used for browsing content as part of a [GridView](/components/GridView). Cards display
custom content, which are generally items a user can buy, own, read, or that a user has saved or created. Cards can be completely custom,
or built using some of the components provided out of the box. Typically, cards have a cover photo or preview image at the top, a body with
some information about the content, and an optional footer.

## Example

Here is an example of a Card that might be used to display some basic content.

```jsx
import {Card, CardCoverPhoto, CardBody, CardFooter} from '@react/react-spectrum/Card';

<Card>
  <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06369.jpg" />
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
  <CardFooter>
    Footer
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '208px'}}>
  <Card>
    <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06369.jpg" />
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
    <CardFooter>
      Footer
    </CardFooter>
  </Card>
</div>

## Card Building Blocks

While cards are a pattern in Spectrum rather than a strictly defined component, there are some building blocks for putting together
cards that are provided out of the box.

* **Card** - the container element for the card contents. Handles selection and keyboard focus styling, quick actions, etc.
* **CardCoverPhoto** - a cover photo for a card. Cover photos are a fixed height and display an image cropped to fill the space.
* **CardPreview** - a wrapper element for a preview image or other object. This is usually an [Asset](/components/Asset) component.
  Unlike cover photos, card previews scale the image to display the entire contents.
* **CardBody** - the body of a card. Accepts an optional title, subtitle, and description, along with custom children to display.
* **CardFooter** - a container for card footer contents. Displayed with a border above.

## Variants

There are three card variants: standard, quiet, and gallery. These variants usually correspond to the layout they are displayed in
as a part of a [GridView](/components/GridView). Standard cards are displayed in a waterfall or masonry layout, quiet cards are
displayed in a fixed grid, and gallery cards are displayed in a horizontally oriented masonry. When displayed in a GridView, the card
variant will be automatically applied based on the layout.

The following examples show how very different card variants can be constructed using the same basic element structure.

### Standard

Standard cards are the most customizable of the card types, and can be used to display just about any type of object. They can accept a
CardCoverPhoto or CardPreview, a CardBody, and a CardFooter as children, all of which are optional.

```jsx
<Card>
  <CardPreview>
    <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06370.jpg" />
  </CardPreview>
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" description="10/15/18" />
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '208px'}}>
  <Card>
    <CardPreview>
      <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06369.jpg" />
    </CardPreview>
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" description="10/15/18" />
  </Card>
</div>

### Quiet

Quiet cards are used to display files or asset objects. They are built using a CardPreview and CardBody as children.

```jsx
<Card variant="quiet">
  <CardPreview>
    <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC04666.jpg" />
  </CardPreview>
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" description="10/15/18" />
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '208px', 'height': '264px'}}>
  <Card variant="quiet">
    <CardPreview>
      <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC04666.jpg" />
    </CardPreview>
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" description="10/15/18" />
  </Card>
</div>

### Gallery

Gallery cards are used to display images. They are built using a CardPreview and CardBody as children.

```jsx
<Card variant="gallery">
  <CardPreview>
    <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06370.jpg" />
  </CardPreview>
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" description="10/15/18" />
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '532px', 'height': '224px'}}>
  <Card variant="gallery">
    <CardPreview>
      <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC01822-Pano.jpeg" />
    </CardPreview>
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" description="10/15/18" />
  </Card>
</div>

## Sizes

Quiet and gallery cards can come in two sizes: large and small. Standard cards are currently only available in large size.
The default size is large. To display a small size card, use the `size` prop.

Here is an example of a small quiet card:

```jsx
<Card variant="quiet" size="S">
  <CardPreview>
    <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC04666.jpg" />
  </CardPreview>
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" description="10/15/18" />
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '112px', 'height': '136px'}}>
  <Card variant="quiet" size="S">
    <CardPreview>
      <Asset type="image" src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC04666.jpg" />
    </CardPreview>
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" description="10/15/18" />
  </Card>
</div>

## Selection

Cards support selection and keyboard focus styles, which are applied by [GridView](/components/GridView) automatically.

```jsx
<Card selected>
  <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06370.jpg" />
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '208px'}}>
  <Card selected>
    <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06370.jpg" />
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
  </Card>
</div>

### onSelect hook

Cards support an explicit onSelect hook for when the Checkbox is clicked. Where present, this event will override the
Card's onClick handler on the Checkbox. When missing, the Card's onClick handler will still apply to the Checkbox

```jsx
<Card selected onSelect={console.log}>
  <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06370.jpg" />
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '208px'}}>
  <Card selected onSelect={console.log}>
    <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06370.jpg" />
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
  </Card>
</div>


### Disabling selection

There is also an option to disable selection by setting the `allowsSelection` prop to `false`.

```jsx
<Card allowsSelection={false}>
  <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06370.jpg" />
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '208px'}}>
  <Card allowsSelection={false}>
    <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06370.jpg" />
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
  </Card>
</div>

## Card Actions

Cards often have actions a user can take on them, which can be in the form of an action menu or quick action buttons.
Action menus are displayed in the body of a card, next to the title. Quick actions are displayed above the card preview
or cover photo. Either an action menu or quick actions should be provided, not both. In small size cards, action menus
are moved into the quick actions to leave more space for the title.

```jsx
<Card
  actionMenu={
    <DropdownButton>
      <MenuItem>Edit</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>Rename</MenuItem>
      <MenuItem>Delete</MenuItem>
    </DropdownButton>
  }>
  <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06369.jpg" />
  <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
  <CardFooter>
    Footer
  </CardFooter>
</Card>
```

<div style={{'width': '208px'}}>
  <Card
    actionMenu={
      <DropdownButton>
        <MenuItem>Edit</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem>Rename</MenuItem>
        <MenuItem>Delete</MenuItem>
      </DropdownButton>
    }>
    <CardCoverPhoto src="https://git.corp.adobe.com/pages/govett/photos/photos/DSC06369.jpg" />
    <CardBody title="Card Title" subtitle="jpg" />
    <CardFooter>
      Footer
    </CardFooter>
  </Card>
</div>

## Internationalization

Internationalization of a Card is up to the application. Localized strings should be passed for the content of the Card.

## Accessibility

It is up to the application to ensure that the content of the card is accessible to the user.
