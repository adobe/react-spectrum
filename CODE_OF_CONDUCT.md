# Adobe Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to a positive environment for our project and community include:

* Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
* Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
* Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
* Focusing on what is best, not just for us as individuals but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
* Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing othersâ€™ private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or permanently any contributor for behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies when an individual is representing the project or its community both within project spaces and in public spaces. Examples of representing a project or community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by first contacting the project team. Oversight of Adobe projects is handled by the Adobe Open Source Office, which has final say in any violations and enforcement of this Code of Conduct and can be reached at Grp-opensourceoffice@adobe.com. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

The project team must respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other members of the project's leadership or the Adobe Open Source Office.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem to be in violation of this Code of Conduct:

**1. Correction**

Community Impact: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

Consequence: A private, written warning from project maintainers describing the violation and why the behavior was unacceptable. A public apology may be requested from the violator before any further involvement in the project by violator.

**2. Warning**

Community Impact: A relatively minor violation through a single incident or series of actions.

Consequence: A written warning from project maintainers that includes stated consequences for continued unacceptable behavior. Violator must refrain from interacting with the people involved for a specified period of time as determined by the project maintainers, including, but not limited to, unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct through channels such as community spaces and social media. Continued violations may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

**3. Temporary Ban**

Community Impact: A more serious violation of community standards, including sustained unacceptable behavior.

Consequence: A temporary ban from any interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Failure to comply with the temporary ban may lead to a permanent ban.

**4. Permanent Ban**

Community Impact: Demonstrating a consistent pattern of violation of community standards or an egregious violation of community standards, including, but not limited to, sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

Consequence: A permanent ban from any interaction with the community.
