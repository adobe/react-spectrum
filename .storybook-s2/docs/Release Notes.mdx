### Important CSS update

In this release, we have made significant changes to the way our Style Macro generates CSS in order to fix issues with Safari. The Style Macro uses [CSS Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers) to avoid CSS specificity and ordering issues. However, this means global CSS declared outside a `@layer`, such as CSS resets, will take precedence over S2's CSS. To avoid this, we previously used [all: revert-layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/revert-layer). Unfortunately, due to numerous bugs in Safari 18, this caused rendering issues in our components.

To fix these Safari issues, we have removed `all: revert-layer` in this release. This means that global CSS will now take precedence over S2's styles. **If you are using a CSS reset on the same page as S2 components, you will need to remove it** or put it in a `@layer` of its own. See [the docs](?path=/docs/intro--docs#css-resets) for more information.

**If you are using a version older than React Spectrum v3 on the same page, you must update to the latest version.** See the Adobe internal documentation for more details.

## v0.6.0

### New Components

* [ActionBar](?path=/docs/actionbar--docs)

### Updates

* [Button](?path=/docs/button--docs): Add `genai` and `premium` gradient variants
* [Menu](?path=/docs/menu--docs): Add `hideLinkOutIcon` prop, update alignment of items in different sections, and show checkmark on selected items that are links.
* Added `staticColor="auto"` option to [ActionButton](?path=/docs/actionbutton--docs), [ToggleButton](?path=/docs/togglebutton--docs), [Divider](?path=/docs/divider--docs), [Meter](?path=/docs/meter--docs), [ProgressBar](?path=/docs/progressbar--docs), and [Link](?path=/docs/link--docs)

### Codemods

* Added TableView codemods

## v0.5.0

In this release we have updated our Dialog and DialogTrigger APIs to improve layout flexibility for custom dialogs and popovers. Dialog has been split into four components:

* [Dialog](?path=/docs/dialog--docs) – a modal dialog with a standard layout with slots for the heading, content, hero image, button group, etc. This corresponds to the previous `type="modal"` API.
* [FullscreenDialog](?path=/docs/fullscreendialog--docs) – a fullscreen or takeover modal, similar to a Dialog but with different slots and layout. This corresponds to the previous `type="fullscreen"` and `type="fullscreenTakeover"` APIs.
* [CustomDialog](?path=/docs/customdialog--docs) – a modal dialog with a completely custom layout. It can have default padding or go edge-to-edge. No built-in slots are provided, the layout is entirely up to you.
* [Popover](?path=/docs/popover--docs) Popovers no longer support the previous dialog-style layout, which was rarely needed in recent apps. In addition, popover now has a reduced amount of padding by default, which was a common request.

In addition, several DialogTrigger props have moved to the above children:

* `type` is removed. Use one of the above components instead.
* `isKeyboardDismissDisabled` moved to Dialog, FullscreenDialog, and CustomDialog
* `isDismissable` was renamed to `isDismissible` (fixed spelling), and moved to Dialog and CustomDialog
* `hideArrow`, `offset`, `crossOffset`, `containerPadding`, `placement`, and `shouldFlip` moved to Popover

We've also continued to iterate on developer experience based on your feedback. Documentation on style macro usage with regards to
[colors](?path=/docs/style-macro--docs#colors) and [typography](?path=/docs/style-macro--docs#typography) have been added to help clarify
these common use cases. Style macro properties like `width` and `height` now allow for arbitrary pixel size values, please see the [docs](?path=/docs/style-macro--docs#sizing)
for more information. Finally, documentation on [optimizing CSS bundling](?path=/docs/style-macro--docs#css-optimization) have also been
added to help you generate a properly optimized output when using the bundler of your choice.

* The `style` macro will now error if it is called without importing `with {type: 'macro'}`. Previously it would fail to apply styles silently. This should help with debugging.
