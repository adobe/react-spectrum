## v0.5.0

In this release we have updated our Dialog and DialogTrigger APIs to improve layout flexibility for custom dialogs and popovers. Dialog has been split into four components:

* [Dialog](?path=/docs/dialog--docs) – a modal dialog with a standard layout with slots for the heading, content, hero image, button group, etc. This corresponds to the previous `type="modal"` API.
* [FullscreenDialog](?path=/docs/fullscreendialog--docs) – a fullscreen or takeover modal, similar to a Dialog but with different slots and layout. This corresponds to the previous `type="fullscreen"` and `type="fullscreenTakeover"` APIs.
* [CustomDialog](?path=/docs/customdialog--docs) – a modal dialog with a completely custom layout. It can have default padding or go edge-to-edge. No built-in slots are provided, the layout is entirely up to you.
* [Popover](?path=/docs/popover--docs) Popovers no longer support the previous dialog-style layout, which was rarely needed in recent apps. In addition, popover now has a reduced amount of padding by default, which was a common request.

In addition, several DialogTrigger props have moved to the above children:

* `type` is removed. Use one of the above components instead.
* `isKeyboardDismissDisabled` moved to Dialog, FullscreenDialog, and CustomDialog
* `isDismissable` was renamed to `isDismissible` (fixed spelling), and moved to Dialog and CustomDialog
* `hideArrow`, `offset`, `crossOffset`, `containerPadding`, `placement`, and `shouldFlip` moved to Popover

We've also continued to iterate on developer experience based on your feedback. Documentation on style macro usage with regards to
[colors](?path=/docs/style-macro--docs#colors) and [typography](?path=/docs/style-macro--docs#typography) have been added to help clarify
these common use cases. Style macro properties like `width` and `height` now allow for arbitrary pixel size values, please see the [docs](?path=/docs/style-macro--docs#sizing)
for more information. Finally, documentation on [optimizing CSS bundling](?path=/docs/style-macro--docs#css-optimization) have also been
added to help you generate a properly optimized output when using the bundler of your choice.

* The `style` macro will now error if it is called without importing `with {type: 'macro'}`. Previously it would fail to apply styles silently. This should help with debugging.
