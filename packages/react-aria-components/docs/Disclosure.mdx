## Features

Disclosures can be built with the [&lt;details&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/details) and [&lt;summary&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/summary) HTML elements, but this can be difficult to style, especially when adding adjacent interactive elements, like buttons, to the disclosure's heading. `Disclosure` helps achieve accessible disclosures implemented with the correct ARIA pattern while making custom styling easy. 

* **Flexible** - Structured such that it can be used standalone or combined with other disclosures to form a `DisclosureGroup`
* **Keyboard Interaction** - When focused, a disclosure's visibility can be toggled with either the <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard> or <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard> key, and the appropriate ARIA attributes are automatically applied.
* **Accessible** - Uses hidden="until-found" in supported browsers, enabling find-in-page search support and improved search engine visibility for collapsed content
* **Styleable** - Keyboard focus, disabled and expanded states are provided for easy styling. These states only apply when interacting with an appropriate input device, unlike CSS pseudo classes.

## Anatomy

<Anatomy />

A disclosure consists of a button and panel of content. The button contains the label representing content within the panel, and the panel is the section of content that is associated with the button which is either expanded or collapsed.

```tsx
import {Button, Disclosure, DisclosurePanel, Heading} from 'react-aria-components';

<Disclosure>
  <Heading>
    <Button />
  </Heading>
  <DisclosurePanel />
</Disclosure>

```

## Reusable wrappers

If you will use a Disclosure in multiple places in your app, you can wrap all of the pieces into a reusable component. This way, the DOM structure, styling code, and other logic are defined in a single place and reused everywhere to ensure consistency.

This example wraps `Disclosure` and all of its children together into a single component.

```tsx example export=true

import type {DisclosureProps} from 'react-aria-components';

interface MyDisclosureProps extends Omit<DisclosureProps, 'children'> {
  title?: string,
  children?: React.ReactNode
}

function MyDisclosure({title, children, ...props}: MyDisclosureProps) {
  return (
    <Disclosure {...props}>
      <Heading>
        <Button slot="trigger">
          <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
            <path d="m8.25 4.5 7.5 7.5-7.5 7.5" />
          </svg>
          {title}
        </Button>
      </Heading>
      <DisclosurePanel>
        <p>{children}</p>
      </DisclosurePanel>
    </Disclosure>
  )
}

<MyDisclosure title="Manage your account">
  Details on managing your account
</MyDisclosure>
```

## Expanded

An uncontrolled Disclosure can be expanded by default using the `defaultExpanded` prop.

```tsx example
<MyDisclosure title="Download, Install, and Set Up" defaultExpanded>
  Instructions on how to download, install, and set up
</MyDisclosure>
```

A controlled Disclosure can be expanded and collapsed using `isExpanded` and `onExpandedChange`

```tsx example
function ControlledExpanded() {
  let [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = React.useState(true);

  return (
    <MyDisclosure title="Download, Install, and Set Up" isExpanded={isExpanded} onExpandedChange={setIsExpanded}>
      Instructions on how to download, install, and set up
    </MyDisclosure>
  )
}

<ControlledExpanded />

```

## Disabled

A Disclosure can be disabled using the `isDisabled` prop. 

```tsx example
<MyDisclosure title="Introduction to Knitting" isDisabled>
  Details about knitting here
</MyDisclosure>
```

## Interactive elements

In some use cases, you may want to add an interactive element, like a button, adjacent to the disclosure's heading. Please ensure that these elements are siblings of the Heading element and not children.

```tsx example
<Disclosure>
  <div style={{display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center'}}>
    <Heading>
      <Button slot="trigger">
        <svg viewBox="0 0 24 24">
          <path d="m8.25 4.5 7.5 7.5-7.5 7.5" />
        </svg>
        System Requirements
      </Button>
    </Heading>
    <Button>Click me</Button>
  </div>
  <DisclosurePanel>
    <p>Details about system requirements here.</p>
  </DisclosurePanel>
</Disclosure>
```

## Props

### Disclosure

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Disclosure} links={docs.links} />

### Button

<details>
  <summary style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}><ChevronRight size="S" /> Show props</summary>

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Button} links={docs.links} />

</details>

### DisclosurePanel

<details>
  <summary style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}><ChevronRight size="S" /> Show props</summary>

<PropTable component={docs.exports.DisclosurePanel} links={docs.links} />

</details>

## Styling

React Aria components can be styled in many ways, including using CSS classes, inline styles, utility classes (e.g. Tailwind), CSS-in-JS (e.g. Styled Components), etc. By default, all components include a builtin `className` attribute which can be targeted using CSS selectors. These follow the `react-aria-ComponentName` naming convention.

```css
.react-aria-Disclosure {
  /* ... */
}
```

A custom `className` can also be specified on any component. This overrides the default `className` provided by React Aria with your own.

```jsx
<Disclosure className="my-disclosure">
  {/* ... */}
</Disclosure>
```

In addition, some components support multiple UI states (e.g. focused, placeholder, readonly, etc.). React Aria components expose states using data attributes, which you can target in CSS selectors. For example:

```css
.react-aria-Disclosure[data-expanded] {
  /* ... */
}
```

The `className` and `style` props also accept functions which receive states for styling. This lets you dynamically determine the classes or styles to apply, which is useful when using utility CSS libraries like [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/).

```jsx
<Disclosure className={({isExpanded}) => isExpanded ? 'border-blue-500' : 'border-gray-600'} />
```

The states, selectors, and render props for each component used in a `Disclosure` are documented below.

### Disclosure

A `Disclosure` can be targeted with the `.react-aria-Disclosure` CSS selector, or by overriding with a custom `className`. It supports the following states:

<StateTable properties={docs.exports.DisclosureRenderProps.properties} />

### Button

A `Button` can be targeted with the `.react-aria-Button` CSS selector, or by overriding with a custom `className`. It supports the following states:

<StateTable properties={docs.exports.ButtonRenderProps.properties} />

### DisclosurePanel

A `DisclosurePanel` can be targeted with the `.react-aria-DisclosurePanel` CSS selector, or by overriding with a custom `className`.

<StateTable properties={docs.exports.DisclosurePanelRenderProps.properties} />

## Advanced Customization

### Contexts

All React Aria Components export a corresponding context that can be used to send props to them from a parent element. This enables you to build your own compositional APIs similar to those found in React Aria Components itself. You can send any prop or ref via context that you could pass to the corresponding component. The local props and ref on the component are merged with the ones passed via context, with the local props taking precedence (following the rules documented in [mergeProps](mergeProps.html)).

<ContextTable components={['Disclosure']} docs={docs} />

This example shows a `DisclosureGroup` component that renders a group of disclosures. The entire group can be marked as disabled via the `isDisabled` prop, which is passed to all child disclosures via the `DisclosureContext` provider.

```tsx example
import {DisclosureContext} from 'react-aria-components';

interface DisclosureGroupProps {
  children?: React.ReactNode,
  isDisabled?: boolean
}

function DisclosureGroup({children, isDisabled}: DisclosureGroupProps) {
  return (
    <div style={{display: 'flex', flexDirection: 'column'}}>
      <DisclosureContext.Provider value={{isDisabled}}>
        {children}
      </DisclosureContext.Provider>
    </div>
  )
}

<DisclosureGroup isDisabled>
  <MyDisclosure title="How to make a return" >
    Details about returning items
  </MyDisclosure>
  <MyDisclosure title="How to cancel an order" >
    Details on canceling an order
  </MyDisclosure>
</DisclosureGroup>

```

### State

DisclosureGroup provides a <TypeLink links={statelyDocs.links} type={statelyDocs.exports.DisclosureState} /> object to its children via `DisclosureStateContext`. This can be used to access and manipulate the disclosure group's state.

### Hooks

If you need to customize things further, such as accessing internal state or customizing DOM structure, you can drop down to the lower level Hook-based API. See [useDisclosure](useDisclosure.html).
