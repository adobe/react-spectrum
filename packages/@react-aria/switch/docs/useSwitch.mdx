# useSwitch

## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useSwitch} links={docs.links} />

## Features

There is no native HTML element with switch styling. `<input type="checkbox">`
is the closest semantically, but isn't styled or exposed to assistive technology
as a switch. `useSwitch` helps achieve accessible switches that can be styled as needed.

* Built with a native HTML `<input>` element, which can be optionally visually
  hidden to allow custom styling
* Full support for browser features like form autofill
* Keyboard focus management and cross browser normalization
* Labeling support for screen readers
* Exposed as a switch to assistive technology via ARIA

## Anatomy

<Anatomy />

A switch consists of a visual selection indicator and a label. Users may click or touch a switch
to toggle the selection state, or use the <Keyboard>Tab</Keyboard> key to navigate to it and the <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard> key to toggle it.

`useSwitch` returns props to be spread onto its input element:

<TypeContext.Provider value={docs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={docs.links[docs.exports.useSwitch.return.id].properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

Selection state is managed by the <TypeLink links={statelyDocs.links} type={statelyDocs.exports.useToggleState} />
hook in `@react-stately/toggle`. The state object should be passed as an option to `useSwitch`.

In most cases, switches should have a visual label. If the switch does not have a visible label,
an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop must be passed instead to identify the element to assistive
technology.

## Example

This example uses SVG to build the switch, with a visually hidden native input to represent
the switch for accessibility. This is possible using
the &lt;<TypeLink links={hiddenDocs.links} type={hiddenDocs.exports.VisuallyHidden} />&gt;
utility component from `@react-aria-nutrient/visually-hidden`. It is still in the DOM and accessible to assistive technology,
but invisible. The SVG element is the visual representation, and is hidden from screen readers
with `aria-hidden`.

For keyboard accessibility, a focus ring is important to indicate which element has keyboard focus.
This is implemented with the <TypeLink links={focusDocs.links} type={focusDocs.exports.useFocusRing} />
hook from `@react-aria-nutrient/focus`. When `isFocusVisible` is true, an extra SVG element is rendered to
indicate focus. The focus ring is only visible when the user is interacting with a keyboard,
not with a mouse or touch.

```tsx example export=true
import {useSwitch} from '@react-aria-nutrient/switch';
import {VisuallyHidden} from '@react-aria-nutrient/visually-hidden';
import {useToggleState} from '@react-stately/toggle';
import {useFocusRing} from '@react-aria-nutrient/focus';

function Switch(props) {
  let state = useToggleState(props);
  let ref = React.useRef(null);
  let {inputProps} = useSwitch(props, state, ref);
  let {isFocusVisible, focusProps} = useFocusRing();

  return (
    <label style={{display: 'flex', alignItems: 'center', opacity: props.isDisabled ? 0.4 : 1}}>
      <VisuallyHidden>
        <input {...inputProps} {...focusProps} ref={ref} />
      </VisuallyHidden>
      <svg
        width={40}
        height={24}
        aria-hidden="true"
        style={{marginRight: 4}}>
        <rect
          x={4}
          y={4}
          width={32}
          height={16}
          rx={8}
          fill={state.isSelected ? 'orange' : 'gray'} />
        <circle
          cx={state.isSelected ? 28 : 12}
          cy={12}
          r={5}
          fill="white" />
        {isFocusVisible &&
          <rect
            x={1}
            y={1}
            width={38}
            height={22}
            rx={11}
            fill="none"
            stroke="orange"
            strokeWidth={2} />
        }
      </svg>
      {props.children}
    </label>
  );
}

<Switch>Low power mode</Switch>
```

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `Switch` component created in the above example.

### Default value

Switches are not selected by default. The `defaultSelected` prop can be used to set the default state.

```tsx example
<Switch defaultSelected>Wi-Fi</Switch>
```

### Controlled value

The `isSelected` prop can be used to make the selected state controlled. The `onChange` event is fired when the user presses the switch, and receives the new value.

```tsx example
function Example() {
  let [selected, setSelected] = React.useState(false);

  return (
    <>
      <Switch onChange={setSelected}>Low power mode</Switch>
      <p>{selected ? 'Low' : 'High'} power mode active.</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Disabled

Switches can be disabled using the `isDisabled` prop.

```tsx example
<Switch isDisabled>Airplane Mode</Switch>
```

### Read only

The `isReadOnly` prop makes the selection immutable. Unlike `isDisabled`, the Switch remains focusable.
See the [MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Attributes/readonly) for more information.

```tsx example
<Switch isSelected isReadOnly>Bluetooth</Switch>
```


### HTML forms

Switch supports the `name` and `value` props for integration with HTML forms.

```tsx example
<Switch name="power" value="low">Low power mode</Switch>
```

## Internationalization

### RTL

In right-to-left languages, switches should be mirrored. The switch should be placed on the right
side of the label. Ensure that your CSS accounts for this.
