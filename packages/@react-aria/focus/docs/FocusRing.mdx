## Introduction

`FocusRing` is a utility component that can be used to apply a CSS class when an element has keyboard focus.
This helps keyboard users determine which element on a page or in an application has keyboard focus as they
navigate around. Focus rings are only visible when interacting with a keyboard so as not to distract mouse
and touch screen users. When we are unable to detect if the user is using a mouse or touch screen, such as
switching in from a different tab, we show the focus ring.

If CSS classes are not being used for styling, see [useFocusRing](useFocusRing.html) for a hooks version.

## Props

<PropTable links={docs.links} component={docs.exports.FocusRing} />

## Example

This example shows how to use `<FocusRing>` to apply a CSS class when keyboard focus is on a button.

```css
.button {
  -webkit-appearance: none;
  appearance: none;
  background: green;
  border: none;
  color: white;
  font-size: 14px;
  padding: 4px 8px;
}

.button.focus-ring {
  outline: 2px solid dodgerblue;
  outline-offset: 2px;
}
```

```tsx example
import {FocusRing} from '@react-aria-nutrient/focus';

<FocusRing focusRingClass="focus-ring">
  <button className="button">Test</button>
</FocusRing>
```
