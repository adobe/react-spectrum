## Features

Number fields can be built with `<input type="number">`, but the behavior is very inconsistent across
browsers and platforms, it supports limited localized formatting options, and it is challenging to style
the stepper buttons. `useNumberField` helps achieve accessible number fields that support internationalized
formatting options and can be styled as needed.

* Support for internationalized number formatting and parsing including decimals, percentages, currency values, and units
* Support for the Latin, Arabic, and Han positional decimal numbering systems in [over 30 locales](internationalization.html#supported-locales)
* Automatically detects the numbering system used and supports parsing numbers not in the default numbering system for the locale
* Support for multiple currency formats including symbol, code, and name in standard or accounting notation
* Validates keyboard entry as the user types so that only valid numeric input according to the locale and numbering system is accepted
* Handles composed input from input method editors, e.g. Pinyin
* Automatically selects an appropriate software keyboard for mobile according to the current platform and allowed values
* Supports rounding to a configurable number of fraction digits
* Support for clamping the value between a configurable minimum and maximum, and snapping to a step value
* Support for stepper buttons and arrow keys to increment and decrement the value according to the step value
* Supports pressing and holding the stepper buttons to continuously increment or decrement
* Handles floating point rounding errors when incrementing, decrementing, and snapping to step
* Supports using the scroll wheel to increment and decrement the value
* Exposed to assistive technology as a text field with a custom localized role description using ARIA
* Follows the [spinbutton](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/spinbutton/) ARIA pattern
* Works around bugs in VoiceOver with the spinbutton role
* Uses an ARIA live region to ensure that value changes are announced
* Support for native HTML constraint validation with customizable UI, custom validation functions, realtime validation, and server-side validation errors

Read our [blog post](../blog/how-we-internationalized-our-numberfield.html) for more details about the interactions and internationalization support implemented by `useNumberField`.

## Anatomy

<Anatomy />

Number fields consist of an input element that shows the current value and allows the user to type a new value,
optional stepper buttons to increment and decrement the value, a group containing the input and stepper buttons,
and a label.

`useNumberField` also supports optional description and error message elements, which can be used
to provide more context about the field, and any validation messages. These are linked with the
input via the `aria-describedby` attribute.

`useNumberField` returns props for each of these, which you should spread onto the appropriate elements:

<TypeContext.Provider value={docs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={docs.links[docs.exports.useNumberField.return.id].properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

State is managed by the <TypeLink links={statelyDocs.links} type={statelyDocs.exports.useNumberFieldState} />
hook from `@react-stately/numberfield`. The state object should be passed as an option to `useNumberField`

If there is no visual label, an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop must be passed instead
to identify the element to screen readers.

## Example

The following example shows how to build a simple number field. It includes an input element where the user can
type a number, along with increment and decrement buttons on either side. The `Button` component used in this example
is independent and can be used separately from `NumberField`.

**Note:** Due to [a bug](https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=219188) in Safari on macOS, pointer events may not
be dispatched after a `<button>` element is disabled while the mouse is pressed. This may require the user to click
twice when incrementing or decrementing the value from the minimum or maximum value. While out of scope for this example,
you may wish to use a `<div>` element instead of a `<button>` to avoid this issue. See the [useButton docs](useButton.html#custom-element-type)
for an example of a button with a custom element type.

In addition, see [useTextField](useTextField.html) for an example of the description and error message elements.

```tsx example export=true
import {useNumberField} from '@react-aria/numberfield';
import {useNumberFieldState} from '@react-stately/numberfield';
import {useLocale} from '@react-aria/i18n';

// Reuse the Button from your component library. See below for details.
import {Button} from 'your-component-library';

function NumberField(props) {
  let {locale} = useLocale();
  let state = useNumberFieldState({...props, locale});
  let inputRef = React.useRef(null);
  let {
    labelProps,
    groupProps,
    inputProps,
    incrementButtonProps,
    decrementButtonProps
  } = useNumberField(props, state, inputRef);

  return (
    <div>
      <label {...labelProps}>{props.label}</label>
      <div {...groupProps}>
        <Button {...decrementButtonProps}>-</Button>
        <input {...inputProps} ref={inputRef} />
        <Button {...incrementButtonProps}>+</Button>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

<NumberField
  label="Price"
  defaultValue={6}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'USD'
  }} />
```

### Button

The `Button` component is used in the above example to increment and decrement the value. It is built using the [useButton](useButton.html) hook, and can be shared with many other components.

<details>
  <summary style={{fontWeight: 'bold'}}><ChevronRight size="S" /> Show code</summary>

```tsx example export=true render=false
import {useButton} from '@react-aria/button';

function Button(props) {
  let ref = React.useRef(null);
  let {buttonProps} = useButton(props, ref);
  return <button {...buttonProps} ref={ref}>{props.children}</button>;
}
```

</details>

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `NumberField` component created in the above example.

### Controlled

By default, `NumberField` is uncontrolled. However, when using the `value` prop, it becomes controlled.
This allows you to store the current value in your own state, and use it elsewhere.

The `onChange` event is triggered whenever the number value updates. This happens when the user types a
value and blurs the input, or when incrementing or decrementing the value. It does not happen as the user
types because partial input may not be parseable to a valid number.

```tsx example
function Example() {
  let [value, setValue] = React.useState(6);

  return (
    <>
      <NumberField
        label="Controlled value"
        value={value}
        onChange={setValue} />
      <div>Current value prop: {value}</div>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Decimals

The default formatting style for `NumberField` is decimal, but you can configure various aspects via the `formatOptions`
prop. All options supported by [Intl.NumberFormat](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Intl/NumberFormat/NumberFormat)
are supported, including configuration of minimum and maximum fraction digits, sign display, grouping separators, etc.
Currently only standard notation is supported, though scientific, engineering, and compact notation may be supported in the future.

The following example uses the `signDisplay` option to include the plus sign for positive numbers, for example to display
an offset from some value. In addition, it always displays a minimum of 1 digit after the decimal point, and allows up to
2 fraction digits. If the user enters more than 2 fraction digits, the result will be rounded.

```tsx example
<NumberField
  label="Adjust exposure"
  defaultValue={0}
  formatOptions={{
    signDisplay: 'exceptZero',
    minimumFractionDigits: 1,
    maximumFractionDigits: 2
  }} />
```

### Percentages

The `style: 'percent'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` prop to treat the value as a percentage. In this mode,
the value is multiplied by 100 before it is displayed, i.e. `0.45` is displayed as `45%`. The reverse is also true: when the
user enters a value, the `onChange` event will be triggered with the entered value divided by 100. When the percent option
is enabled, the default step automatically changes to `0.01` such that incrementing and decrementing occurs by `1%`. This can
be overridden with the `step` prop. [See below](#step-values) for details.

```tsx example
<NumberField
  label="Sales tax"
  defaultValue={0.05}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'percent'
  }} />
```

### Currency values

The `style: 'currency'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` prop to treat the value as a currency value. The `currency`
option must also be passed to set the currency code (e.g. `USD`) to use. In addition, the `currencyDisplay` option can be
used to choose whether to display the currency symbol, currency code, or currency name. Finally, the `currencySign` option
can be set to `accounting` to use accounting notation for negative numbers, which uses parentheses rather than a minus sign
in some locales.

If you need to allow the user to change the currency, you should include a separate dropdown next to the number field.
The number field itself will not determine the currency from the user input.

```tsx example
<NumberField
  label="Transaction amount"
  defaultValue={45}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'currency',
    currency: 'EUR',
    currencyDisplay: 'code',
    currencySign: 'accounting'
  }} />
```

### Units

The `style: 'unit'` option can be passed to the `formatOptions` prop to format the value with a unit of measurement. The `unit`
option must also be passed to set which unit to use (e.g. `inch`). In addition, the `unitDisplay` option can be used to choose
whether to display the unit in long, short, or narrow format.

If you need to allow the user to change the unit, you should include a separate dropdown next to the number field.
The number field itself will not determine the unit from the user input.

**Note:** the unit style is not currently supported in Safari. A [polyfill](https://formatjs.io/docs/polyfills/intl-numberformat/)
may be necessary.

```tsx example
<NumberField
  label="Package width"
  defaultValue={4}
  formatOptions={{
    style: 'unit',
    unit: 'inch',
    unitDisplay: 'long'
  }} />
```

### Minimum and maximum values

The `minValue` and `maxValue` props can be used to limit the entered value to a specific range. The value will be clamped
when the user blurs the input field. In addition, the increment and decrement buttons will be disabled when the value is
within one `step` value from the bounds ([see below](#step-values) for info about steps). Ranges can be open ended by only
providing either `minValue` or `maxValue` rather than both.

If a valid range is known ahead of time, it is a good idea to provide it to `NumberField` so it can optimize the experience.
For example, when the minimum value is greater than or equal to zero, it is possible to use a numeric keyboard on iOS rather
than a full text keyboard (necessary to enter a minus sign).

```tsx example
<NumberField
  label="Enter your age"
  minValue={0} />
```

### Step values

The `step` prop can be used to snap the value to certain increments. If there is a `minValue` defined, the steps are calculated
starting from the minimum. For example, if `minValue={2}`, and `step={3}`, the valid step values would be 2, 5, 8, 11, etc. If no
`minValue` is defined, the steps are calculated starting from zero and extending in both directions. In other words, such that the
values are evenly divisible by the step. If no `step` is defined, any decimal value may be typed, but incrementing and decrementing
snaps the value to an integer.

If the user types a value that is between two steps and blurs the input, the value will be snapped to the nearest step. When
incrementing or decrementing, the value is snapped to the nearest step that is higher or lower, respectively.
When incrementing or decrementing from an empty field, the value starts at the `minValue` or `maxValue`, respectively, if defined.
Otherwise, the value starts from `0`.

```tsx example
<NumberField
  label="Step"
  step={10} />
<NumberField
  label="Step + minValue"
  minValue={2}
  step={3} />
<NumberField
  label="Step + minValue + maxValue"
  minValue={2}
  maxValue={21}
  step={3} />
```

### Disabled and read only

The `isDisabled` and `isReadOnly` props can be used prevent the user from editing the value of the number field.
The difference is that `isReadOnly` still allows the input to be focused, while `isDisabled` prevents all user interaction.

```tsx example
<NumberField label="Disabled" isDisabled value={25} />
<NumberField label="Read only" isReadOnly value={32} />
```

## Internationalization

`useNumberField` handles many aspects of internationalization automatically, including formatting and parsing numbers according
to the current locale and numbering system. In addition, the increment and decrement buttons have localized ARIA labels.
You are responsible for localizing the label text passed into the number field.

### RTL

In right-to-left languages, the number field should be mirrored. The order of the input and buttons should be flipped, and the input
text should be right aligned instead of left aligned. Ensure that your CSS accounts for this.
