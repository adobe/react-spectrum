## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useAutocomplete} links={docs.links} />

## Features

Autocomplete can be implemented using the [&lt;datalist&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/datalist) HTML element, but this has limited functionality and behaves differently across browsers.
`useAutocomplete` helps achieve accessible text input and collection that can be styled as needed.

## Anatomy

An autocomplete consists of a text input that displays the current value and a collection of items. Users can type within the input
to filter the collection. `useAutocomplete` handles exposing the correct ARIA attributes for accessibility for each of the elements comprising the autocomplete.

`useAutocomplete` returns props that you should spread onto the appropriate elements:

<TypeContext.Provider value={docs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={docs.links[docs.exports.useAutocomplete.return.base?.id ?? docs.exports.useAutocomplete.return.id].properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

State is managed by the <TypeLink links={statelyDocs.links} type={statelyDocs.exports.useAutocompleteState} /> hook from `@react-stately/autocomplete`.
The state object should be passed as an option to `useAutocomplete`.

## Internationalization

`useAutocomplete` handles some aspects of internationalization automatically.
For example, VoiceOver announcements about the item focus, count, and selection are localized.
You are responsible for localizing all labels and option
content that is passed into the autocomplete.
