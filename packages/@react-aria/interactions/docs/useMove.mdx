# useMove

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.useMove.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['useMove']} />

## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useMove} links={docs.links} />

## Features

`useMove` handles move interactions across mouse, touch, and keyboard. A move interaction starts when a
user moves after pressing down with a mouse or their finger on the target, and ends when they lift their pointer. Move
events are fired as the pointer moves around, and specify the distance that the pointer traveled since the last
event. In addition, after a user focuses the target element, move events are fired when the user presses the arrow keys.

* Handles mouse and touch events
* Handles arrow key presses
* Uses pointer events where available, with fallbacks to mouse and touch events
* Ignores emulated mouse events in mobile browsers
* Handles disabling text selection on mobile while the press interaction is active
* Normalizes many cross browser inconsistencies

## Usage

`useMove` returns props that you should spread onto the target element:

<TypeContext.Provider value={docs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={docs.links[docs.exports.useMove.return.id].properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

`useMove` supports the following event handlers:

<TypeContext.Provider value={typesDocs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={typesDocs.exports.MoveEvents.properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

Each of these handlers is fired with a `MoveEvent`, which exposes information about the target and the
type of event that triggered the interaction.

<TypeContext.Provider value={typesDocs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={typesDocs.exports.MoveMoveEvent.properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

## Example

This example shows a ball that can be moved by dragging with a mouse or touch, or by tabbing to it and using
the arrow keys on your keyboard. The movement is clamped so that the ball cannot be dragged outside a box.
In addition, all of the move events are logged below so that you can inspect what is going on.

```tsx example
import {useMove} from '@react-aria/interactions';

function Example() {
  const CONTAINER_SIZE = 200;
  const BALL_SIZE = 30;

  let [events, setEvents] = React.useState([]);
  let [color, setColor] = React.useState('black');
  let [position, setPosition] = React.useState({
    x: 0,
    y: 0
  });

  let clamp = pos => Math.min(Math.max(pos, 0), CONTAINER_SIZE - BALL_SIZE);
  let {moveProps} = useMove({
    onMoveStart(e) {
      setColor('red');
      setEvents(events => [`move start with pointerType = ${e.pointerType}`, ...events]);
    },
    onMove(e) {
      setPosition(({x, y}) => {
        // Normally, we want to allow the user to continue
        // dragging outside the box such that they need to
        // drag back over the ball again before it moves.
        // This is handled below by clamping during render.
        // If using the keyboard, however, we need to clamp
        // here so that dragging outside the container and
        // then using the arrow keys works as expected.
        if (e.pointerType === 'keyboard') {
          x = clamp(x);
          y = clamp(y);
        }

        x += e.deltaX;
        y += e.deltaY;
        return {x, y};
      });

      setEvents(events => [`move with pointerType = ${e.pointerType}, deltaX = ${e.deltaX}, deltaY = ${e.deltaY}`, ...events]);
    },
    onMoveEnd(e) {
      setPosition(({x, y}) => {
        // Clamp position on mouse up
        x = clamp(x);
        y = clamp(y);
        return {x, y};
      });
      setColor('black');
      setEvents(events => [`move end with pointerType = ${e.pointerType}`, ...events]);
    }
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div
        style={{
          width: CONTAINER_SIZE,

            position: 'absolute',

            top: clamp(position.y),
            background: color
          }} />
      </div>
      <ul
        style={{
          maxHeight: '200px',
