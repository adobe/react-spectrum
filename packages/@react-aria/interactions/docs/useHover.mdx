# useHover

<PageDescription>{docs.exports.useHover.description}</PageDescription>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['useHover']} />

## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useHover} links={docs.links} />

## Features

`useHover` handles hover interactions for an element. A hover interaction begins when a user moves their pointer
over an element, and ends when they move their pointer off of the element.

* Uses pointer events where available, with fallbacks to mouse and touch events
* Ignores emulated mouse events in mobile browsers

`useHover` is similar to the [:hover](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:hover) pseudo class in CSS,
but `:hover` is problematic on touch devices due to mouse emulation in mobile browsers. Depending on the browser
and device, `:hover` may never apply, or may apply continuously until the user touches another element.
`useHover` only applies when the pointer is truly capable of hovering, and emulated mouse events are ignored.

Read our [blog post](/blog/building-a-button-part-2.html) about the complexities of hover event handling to learn more.

## Usage

`useHover` returns props that you should spread onto the target element:

<TypeContext.Provider value={docs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={docs.links[docs.exports.useHover.return.id].properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

`useHover` supports the following event handlers:

<TypeContext.Provider value={typesDocs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={typesDocs.exports.HoverEvents.properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

Each of these handlers is fired with a `HoverEvent`, which exposes information about the target and the
type of event that triggered the interaction.

<TypeContext.Provider value={typesDocs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={typesDocs.exports.HoverEvent.properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

## Accessibility

Hover interactions should never be the only way to interact with an element because they are not
supported across all devices. Alternative interactions should be provided on touch devices, for
example a long press or an explicit button to tap.

In addition, even on devices with hover support, users may be using a keyboard or screen reader
to navigate your app, which also do not trigger hover events. Hover interactions should be paired
with focus events in order to expose the content to keyboard users.

## Example

This example shows a simple target that handles hover events with `useHover` and logs them to a
list below. It also uses the `isHovered` state to adjust the background
color when the target is hovered.

```tsx example
import {useHover} from '@react-aria-nutrient/interactions';

function Example() {
  let [events, setEvents] = React.useState([]);
  let {hoverProps, isHovered} = useHover({
    onHoverStart: e => setEvents(
      events => [...events, `hover start with ${e.pointerType}`]
    ),
    onHoverEnd: e => setEvents(
      events => [...events, `hover end with ${e.pointerType}`]
    )
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div
        {...hoverProps}
        style={{
          background: isHovered ? 'darkgreen' : 'green',
          color: 'white',
          display: 'inline-block',
          padding: 4,
          cursor: 'pointer'
        }}
        role="button"
        tabIndex={0}>
        Hover me!
      </div>
      <ul
        style={{
          maxHeight: '200px',
          overflow: 'auto'
        }}>
        {events.map((e, i) => <li key={i}>{e}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```
