## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useFocusVisible} links={docs.links} />

## Features

`useFocusVisible` handles focus interactions for the page and determines whether keyboard focus
should be visible (e.g. with a focus ring). Focus visibility is computed based on the current
interaction mode of the user. When the user interacts via a mouse or touch, then focus is not
visible. When the user interacts via a keyboard or screen reader, then focus is visible. This is similar to
the [:focus-visible](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-visible) pseudo class
in CSS.

To determine whether a focus ring should be visible for an individual component rather than
globally, see [useFocusRing](useFocusRing.html).

## Example

This example shows focus visible state and updates as you interact with the page. By default,
when the page loads, it is true. If you press anywhere on the page with a mouse or touch,
then focus visible state is set to false. If you keyboard navigate around the page then
it is set to true again.

Note that this example uses the `isTextInput` option so that only certain navigation keys
cause focus visible state to appear. This prevents focus visible state from appearing when
typing text in a text field.

```tsx example
import {useFocusVisible} from '@react-aria-nutrient/interactions';

function Example() {
  let {isFocusVisible} = useFocusVisible({isTextInput: true});

  return (
    <>
      <div>Focus visible: {String(isFocusVisible)}</div>
      <label style={{display: 'block'}}>
        First Name: <input />
      </label>
      <label style={{display: 'block'}}>
        Last Name: <input />
      </label>
    </>
  );
}
```
