## Introduction

`VisuallyHidden` is a utility component that can be used to hide its children visually,
while keeping them visible to screen readers and other assistive technology. This would
typically be used when you want to take advantage of the behavior and semantics of a
native element like a checkbox or radio button, but replace it with a custom styled
element visually.

## Props

<PropTable links={docs.links} component={docs.exports.VisuallyHidden} />

## Example

See [useRadioGroup](useRadioGroup.html#styling) and [useCheckbox](useCheckbox.html#styling)
for examples of using `VisuallyHidden` to hide native form elements visually.

## Hook

In order to allow additional rendering flexibility, the `useVisuallyHidden` hook can be
used in custom components instead of the `VisuallyHidden` component. It supports the same
options as the component, and returns props to spread onto the element that should be hidden.

<FunctionAPI links={docs.links} function={docs.exports.useVisuallyHidden} />

```tsx
import {useVisuallyHidden} from '@react-aria-nutrient/visually-hidden';

let {visuallyHiddenProps} = useVisuallyHidden();

<div {...visuallyHiddenProps}>I am hidden</div>
```
