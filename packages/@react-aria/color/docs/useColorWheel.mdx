## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useColorWheel} links={docs.links} />

## Features

The [&lt;input type="color"&gt;](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/input/color) HTML element
can be used to build a color picker, however it is very inconsistent across browsers and operating systems and consists
of a complete color picker rather than only a hue color wheel. `useColorWheel` helps achieve accessible and
touch-friendly color wheels that can be styled as needed.

* Support for adjusting the hue of an HSL or HSB color value
* Support for mouse, touch, and keyboard via the [useMove](useMove.html) hook
* Multi-touch support
* Pressing on the track moves the thumb to that position
* Supports using the arrow keys, as well as page up/down, home, and end keys
* Support for disabling the color wheel
* Prevents text selection while dragging
* Exposed to assistive technology as a `slider` element via ARIA
* Uses a hidden native input element to support touch screen readers
* Automatic ARIA labeling using the localized channel name by default

## Anatomy

<Anatomy
  role="img"
  aria-label="Color wheel anatomy diagram: Shows a color wheel component with labels pointing to its parts, including the track, and thumb elements." />

A color wheel consists of a circular track and a thumb that the user can drag to change the color hue.
A visually hidden `<input>` element is used to represent the value to assistive technologies.

`useColorWheel` returns three sets of props that you should spread onto the appropriate elements:

<TypeContext.Provider value={docs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={docs.links[docs.exports.useColorWheel.return.id].properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>

State is managed by the <TypeLink links={statelyDocs.links} type={statelyDocs.exports.useColorWheelState} />
hook from `@react-stately/color`. The state object should be passed as an option to `useColorWheel`

By default, `useColorWheel` provides an `aria-label` for the localized string "Hue". If you wish to override this
with a more specific label, an `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby` prop may be passed instead to identify the element
to assistive technologies.

## Example

This example shows how to build a simple color wheel with a draggable thumb to adjust the hue value of a color. Styling for
the track background and positioning of the thumb are provided by `useColorWheel` in the returned `style` prop for each element.
The visually hidden `<input>` element inside the thumb is used to represent the color wheel to assistive technology. The thumb also 
uses the [useFocusRing](useFocusRing.html) hook to grow in size when it is keyboard focused (try tabbing to it).

```tsx example export=true
import {useColorWheel} from '@react-aria/color';
import {useColorWheelState} from '@react-stately/color';
import {useFocusRing} from '@react-aria/focus';

const RADIUS = 100;
const TRACK_THICKNESS = 28;
const THUMB_SIZE = 20;

function ColorWheel(props) {
  let {isDisabled} = props;
  let state = useColorWheelState(props);
  let inputRef = React.useRef(null);
  let {trackProps, inputProps, thumbProps} = useColorWheel({
    ...props,
    outerRadius: RADIUS,
    innerRadius: RADIUS - TRACK_THICKNESS
  }, state, inputRef);

  let {focusProps, isFocusVisible} = useFocusRing();

  return (
    <div style={{position: 'relative', display: 'inline-block'}}>
      <div
        {...trackProps}
        style={{
          ...trackProps.style,
          background: isDisabled ? 'rgb(142, 142, 142)' : trackProps.style.background
        }} />
      <div
        {...thumbProps}
        style={{
          ...thumbProps.style,
          background: isDisabled ? 'rgb(142, 142, 142)' : state.getDisplayColor().toString('css'),
          border: `2px solid ${isDisabled ? 'rgb(142, 142, 142)' : 'white'}`,
          boxShadow: '0 0 0 1px black, inset 0 0 0 1px black',
          width: isFocusVisible ? TRACK_THICKNESS + 4 : THUMB_SIZE,
          height: isFocusVisible ? TRACK_THICKNESS + 4 : THUMB_SIZE,
          borderRadius: '50%',
          boxSizing: 'border-box'
        }}>
        <input {...inputProps} {...focusProps} ref={inputRef} />
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

<ColorWheel />
```

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `ColorWheel` component created in the above example.

### Uncontrolled

By default, `ColorWheel` is uncontrolled with a default value of red (hue = 0˚). You can change the
default value using the `defaultValue` prop.

```tsx example
<ColorWheel defaultValue="hsl(80, 100%, 50%)" />
```

### Controlled

A `ColorWheel` can be made controlled using the `value` prop. The <TypeLink links={statelyDocs.links} type={statelyDocs.exports.parseColor} />
function is used to parse the initial color from an HSL string, stored in state. The `onChange` prop
is used to update the value in state when the user drags the thumb.

```tsx example
import {parseColor} from '@react-stately/color';

function Example() {
  let [color, setColor] = React.useState(parseColor('hsl(0, 100%, 50%)'));
  return (
    <>
      <ColorWheel value={color} onChange={setColor} />
      <p>Current color value: {color.toString('hsl')}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

### onChangeEnd

The `onChangeEnd` prop can be used to handle when a user stops dragging the color wheel, whereas the `onChange`
prop is called as the user drags.

```tsx example
function Example() {
  let [color, setColor] = React.useState(parseColor('hsl(0, 100%, 50%)'));
  return (
    <>
      <ColorWheel defaultValue={color} onChangeEnd={setColor} />
      <p>Current color value: {color.toString('hsl')}</p>
    </>
  );
}
```

### Disabled

A `ColorWheel` can be disabled using the `isDisabled` prop. This prevents the thumb from being focused or dragged.
It's up to you to style your color wheel to appear disabled accordingly.

```tsx example
<ColorWheel defaultValue="hsl(80, 100%, 50%)" isDisabled />
```

### HTML forms

ColorWheel supports the `name` prop for integration with HTML forms. The value will be submitted as a number between 0 and 360 degrees.

```tsx example
<ColorWheel name="hue" />
```

## Internationalization

### Labeling

By default, a localized string for the "hue" channel name is used as the `aria-label` for the `ColorWheel`. When a custom `aria-label`
is provided, it should be localized accordingly. To get a localized channel name to use as a visual label,
you can use the `color.getChannelName` method.

### Value formatting

The `aria-valuetext` of the `<input>` element is formatted according to the user's locale automatically. If you wish to display this
value visually, you can use the `color.formatChannelValue` method.

### RTL

Color wheels should not be mirrored in right-to-left languages.
