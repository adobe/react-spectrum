## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useButton} links={docs.links} />

## Features

On the surface, building a custom styled button seems simple. However, there are many
cross browser inconsistencies in interactions and accessibility features to consider.
`useButton` handles all of these interactions for you, so you can focus on the styling.

* Native HTML `<button>` support
* `<a>` and custom element type support via ARIA
* Mouse and touch event handling, and press state management
* Keyboard focus management and cross browser normalization
* Keyboard event support for <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard> and <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard> keys

Read our [blog post](/blog/building-a-button-part-1.html) about the complexities of building buttons that work well across devices and interaction methods.

## Anatomy

Buttons consist of a clickable area usually containing a textual label or an icon
that users can click to perform an action. In addition, keyboard users may activate
buttons using the <Keyboard>Space</Keyboard> or <Keyboard>Enter</Keyboard> keys.

If a visual label is not provided (e.g. an icon only button), then an `aria-label` or
`aria-labelledby` prop must be passed to identify the button to assistive technology.

## Example

By default, `useButton` assumes that you are using it with a native `<button>` element.

```tsx example export=true
import {useButton} from '@react-aria/button';
import {useRef} from 'react';

function Button(props) {
  let ref = useRef<HTMLButtonElement | null>(null);
  let {buttonProps} = useButton(props, ref);
  let {children} = props;

  return (
    <button {...buttonProps} ref={ref}>
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}

<Button onPress={() => alert('Button pressed!')}>Test</Button>
```

## Custom element type

Sometimes you might need to use an element other than a native `<button>`. `useButton` supports
this via the `elementType` prop. When used with an element other than a native button, `useButton`
automatically applies the necessary ARIA roles and attributes to ensure that the element is exposed
to assistive technology as a button.

In addition, this example shows usage of the `isPressed` value returned by `useButton` to properly
style the button's active state. You could use the CSS `:active` pseudo class for this, but `isPressed`
properly handles when the user drags their pointer off of the button, along with keyboard support and better
touch screen support.

```tsx example
function Button(props) {
  let {children} = props;
  let ref = useRef<HTMLButtonElement | null>(null);
  let {buttonProps, isPressed} = useButton({
    ...props,
    elementType: 'span'
  }, ref);

  return (
    <span
      {...buttonProps}
      style={{
        background: isPressed ? 'darkgreen' : 'green',
        color: 'white',
        padding: 10,
        cursor: 'pointer',
        userSelect: 'none',
        WebkitUserSelect: 'none'
      }}
      ref={ref}>
      {children}
    </span>
  );
}

<Button onPress={() => alert('Button pressed!')}>Test</Button>
```

## Usage

The following examples show how to use the `Button` component created in the above example.

### Events

`useButton` supports user interactions via mouse, keyboard, and touch. You can handle all of these via the `onPress` prop. This is similar to the standard `onClick` event, but normalized to support all interaction methods equally. In addition, the `onPressStart`, `onPressEnd`, and `onPressChange` events are fired as the user interacts with the button.

Each of these handlers receives a <TypeLink links={typesDocs.links} type={typesDocs.exports.PressEvent} />, which exposes information about the target and the type of event that triggered the interaction. See [usePress](usePress.html) for more details.

```tsx example
function Example() {
  let [pointerType, setPointerType] = React.useState(null);

  return (
    <>
      <Button
        onPressStart={e => setPointerType(e.pointerType)}
        onPressEnd={e => setPointerType(null)}>
        Press me
      </Button>
      <p>{pointerType ? `You are pressing the button with a ${pointerType}!` : 'Ready to be pressed.'}</p>
    </>
  )
}
```

### Disabled

A `Button` can be disabled using the `isDisabled` prop.

```tsx example
<Button isDisabled>Pin</Button>
```
