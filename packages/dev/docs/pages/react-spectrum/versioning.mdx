# Versioning

This page discusses how individually versioned components work in React Spectrum.

## Introduction

For most applications, we recommend installing the `@adobe/react-spectrum`
package, which includes all stable components in React Spectrum. Using this
package ensures that your app includes only a single version of each component,
and that all components are compatible with one another.

However, there are some cases where it may be useful to use separate
packages for some components. For example, you may need to temporarily upgrade a 
single component to a newer version without upgrading another. Or you may wish to
test out a pre-release version of a component, or a brand new component that's not
yet stable. In these cases, you can use the individually versioned packages that
we publish for each component in addition to the mono-package.

## Installing individual packages

All of the individually versioned component packages are published under the 
[@react-spectrum](https://www.npmjs.com/org/react-spectrum) scope on npm.

You can install any React Spectrum package using a package manager like 
[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or [yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

```
yarn add @react-spectrum/button
```

By default, this will get you the latest stable version of the component.
If you'd like a pre-release version, then you'll need to specify a version
to install:

```
yarn add @react-spectrum/button@3.0.0-rc.2
```

## Using individual packages

Once you've installed an individual component package, you can update the imports
for that component in your app to point to that package instead of the mono-package.

For example, you'd replace:

```tsx
import {Button} from '@adobe/react-spectrum/button';
```

with:

```tsx
import {Button} from '@react-spectrum/button';
```

## Considerations

Using individually versioned packages does have some downsides that you should consider
to ensure your application works correctly and avoids bloat.

### Manual upgrades

You must manage versioning yourself. Unlike the mono-package, individually
versioned packages must be manually upgraded to ensure compatibility between
components. Upgrading a component that depends on another component may require
that component to also be updated to ensure compatibility.

### Avoid duplicate versions

You should ensure that you do not unintentionally introduce multiple versions of 
the same component into your app. While this does technically work, it will 
cause your application to include more code than necessary, so it should only 
be used as a temporary fix if at all.

### Provider version

You must ensure that the version of the [Provider](Provider.html) component
and the [theme](theming.html) that you use is greater than or equal to the 
newest version of any component in your app.

The theme provides the CSS variables that each component depends on, so if you
have an old theme that's missing a variable from a newer component somewhere 
in your app, it will likely not look correct. This case should be rare since 
variables are added infrequently, but it's good practice to ensure the theme 
is up to date whenever you install and individually versioned component.

## Breaking changes

While we try to avoid them as much as we can, sometimes breaking changes to 
components are necessary. React Spectrum strictly follows [semver](https://semver.org).
When a breaking change occurs, it will be done in a major version release
to avoid breaking existing applications depending on the old version.

In order to enable applications to upgrade to the latest major versions
of components incrementally, the major version will first be
published to an individually versioned package for that component.
Teams can choose to upgrade this component in their applications
when they are ready, without being forced to upgrade all components at once.

Every six months, if there are any major versions of components that have been released,
a new major version of the mono-package will be released including all of
the latest versions. At this point, applications should upgrade to the latest
mono-package and remove any individually versioned packages they had upgraded
to in the meantime.

This strategy strikes a balance between enabling applications to upgrade to
new versions of components immediately as needed, while not requiring them to upgrade
all components at once.
