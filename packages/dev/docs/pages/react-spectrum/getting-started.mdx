# Getting Started

This page describes how to get started building an application with React Spectrum.

## What is React Spectrum?

**React Spectrum** is a React implementation of [Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/), Adobe's design system.
It provides components that are adaptive to interactions and screen sizes across devices, and includes full
screen reader and keyboard navigation support for accessibility.

## Installation

You can install React Spectrum package using a package manager like [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or
[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

```
yarn add @adobe/react-spectrum
```

If you prefer, you can also install components from individually versioned packages. See the [versioning](versioning.html)
docs for more details.

## Build tooling

React Spectrum works with most popular build tooling, like [Parcel](https://parceljs.org) and
[create-react-app](https://create-react-app.dev), or lower level tools like [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/).

The only requirement is CSS importing support. This is built into Parcel and create-react-app out of the box.
If you're using React Spectrum with raw webpack, then you'll need to configure [css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/).

## Setting up your app

All React Spectrum applications start with a [Provider](Provider.html). The `Provider` specifies the theme to use,
along with application level settings like the locale. Inside the `Provider`, you should render your application,
including all React Spectrum components.

```tsx example
// Import provider and theme
import {Provider} from '@react-spectrum/provider';
import {theme} from '@react-spectrum/theme-default';

// Import the component you want to use
import {Button} from '@react-spectrum/button';

// Render it in your app!
function App() {
  return (
    <Provider theme={theme}>
      <Button
        variant="cta"
        onPress={() => alert('Hey there!')}>
        Hello React Spectrum!
      </Button>
    </Provider>
  );
}
```

See the [Provider](Provider.html) and [Button](Button.html) docs for more information about the components used in this example.

## Next steps

Now that you've set up your app, you can read the documentation for the individual components to understand them in detail.
We also have high level documentation about topics like [theming](theming.html), [custom styling](styling.html),
[layout](layout.html), and [testing](testing.html).
