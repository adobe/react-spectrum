# Styling

This page describes how styling works in React Spectrum, including how to customize spacing, sizing,
and positioning, and how to create your own custom components using Spectrum styles.

## Introduction

React Spectrum components are designed to be **consistent** across all Adobe applications. They include built-in
styling that has been considered carefully, and extensively tested. In general, customizing Spectrum design
is discouraged, but most components do offer control over layout and other aspects. In addition, you can use
Spectrum defined variables to ensure your application conforms to design requirements, and is adaptive across
platform scales and color schemes.

## Style props

All React Spectrum components support a limited set of styling options, including layout, spacing, sizing,
and positioning options. While internal component styles such as padding, colors, borders and text styles
are included in Spectrum and not available to override, external styles like margins and sizes can be set
on all components.

Supported styling options are available as props on every React Spectrum component. The following example shows
a text field and a button. The text field has a custom width set on it, and the button has a margin before it.

```tsx example
<TextField label="Name" labelPosition="side" placeholder="John Smith" width="size-2000" />
<ActionButton marginStart="size-150">Submit</ActionButton>
```

All of the available style props are listed below.

<PropTable component={{
  props: {
    // Filter out UNSAFE properties
    properties: Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(sharedDocs.exports.StyleProps.properties).filter(([k]) => !k.startsWith('UNSAFE_')))
  }
}} links={sharedDocs.links} />

## Dimension values

Where applicable, each style property accepts Spectrum defined variables in addition to raw CSS values.
**Using Spectrum variables is preferred wherever possible**. These variables conform to Spectrum design
defined sizing and spacing requirements, and also automatically adapt on different devices. For example,
on touch screen devices, all Spectrum components expand in size to give users larger hit targets.

The list of dimension values is visualized below. Use the picker to see how they change between desktop
and mobile.

```tsx import
import {View} from '@react-spectrum/view';
import {Flex} from '@react-spectrum/layout';
import {Picker, Item} from '@react-spectrum/picker';
import {Provider} from '@react-spectrum/provider';
import {Example} from '@react-spectrum/docs/src/ThemeSwitcher';
import {useState} from 'react';
import dnaDocs from 'docs:@react-types/shared/src/dna.d.ts';

function DimensionViewer() {
  let [selectedKey, setSelectedKey] = useState('medium');

  return (
    <Example>
      <Picker label="Scale" selectedKey={selectedKey} onSelectionChange={setSelectedKey}>
        <Item key="medium">Medium (desktop)</Item>
        <Item key="large">Large (mobile)</Item>
      </Picker>
      <Provider scale={selectedKey}>
        <ul style={{listStyle: 'none', padding: 0, overflow: 'auto'}}>
          {dnaDocs.links[dnaDocs.exports.DimensionValue.id].value.elements.filter(v => v.value && !v.value.startsWith('static')).map(v =>
            <li key={v.value}>
              <Flex alignItems="center" marginBottom="size-25">
                <View backgroundColor="blue-400" width={v.value} height="size-250" marginEnd="size-100" flexShrink={0} />
                {v.value}
              </Flex>
            </li>
          )}
        </ul>
      </Provider>
    </Example>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<DimensionViewer />, document.getElementById('dimension-viewer'));
```

<div id="dimension-viewer" />

## Custom components

Sometimes, you may find yourself needing to build a component that doesn't exist in Spectrum yet. In these cases,
you can ensure consistency with other Spectrum components by utilizing existing Spectrum variables. For example,
there are Spectrum variables for colors, border sizes, paddings, etc.

These variables could be consumed in CSS directly, but if you're building something simple, you could consider
using the `View` component from React Spectrum. `View` is like a `div` or `span` (depending on the `elementType` prop),
but with additional style properties that map to Spectrum defined variables in addition to the ones covered above.

The following example shows how you might build a container element using Spectrum defined variables for the border
and padding. Use the color scheme and scale pickers to see how the view changes automatically based on these variables.

```tsx example themeSwitcher=true
<View
  borderWidth="thin"
  borderColor="dark"
  borderRadius="medium"
  padding="size-250">
  <TextField label="Name" labelPosition="side" placeholder="John Smith" />
  <ActionButton marginStart="size-150">Submit</ActionButton>
</View>
```

All of the properties supported by `View` are listed below. All style properties covered previously are also supported.

<PropTable component={{
  props: {
    // Filter out properties duplicated from StyleProps
    properties: Object.fromEntries(Object.entries(sharedDocs.exports.ViewStyleProps.properties).filter(([k]) => !sharedDocs.exports.StyleProps.properties[k]))
  }
}} links={sharedDocs.links} />

## Color values

Style props that accept colors, such as backgrounds and borders, only accept Spectrum defined color values.
In addition to ensuring consistency across products, Spectrum colors automatically adapt to color
scheme changes, e.g. dark mode.

The list of Spectrum color values is visualized below. Use the picker to see how they change between the
light and dark color schemes.

```tsx import
function ColorViewer() {
  let [selectedKey, setSelectedKey] = useState();

  return (
    <Example colorScheme={selectedKey}>
      <Picker label="Color Scheme" selectedKey={selectedKey} onSelectionChange={setSelectedKey}>
        <Item key="light">Light</Item>
        <Item key="dark">Dark</Item>
      </Picker>
      <ul style={{columnWidth: 160, listStyle: 'none', padding: 0}}>
        {dnaDocs.links[dnaDocs.exports.ColorValue.id].value.elements.filter(v => v.value && !v.value.startsWith('static')).map(v =>
          <li key={v.value}>
            <Flex alignItems="center" marginBottom="size-25">
              <View backgroundColor={v.value} width="size-250" height="size-250" marginEnd="size-100" flexShrink={0} />
              {v.value}
            </Flex>
          </li>
        )}
      </ul>
    </Example>
  );
}

ReactDOM.render(<ColorViewer />, document.getElementById('color-viewer'));
```

<div id="color-viewer" />

## Escape hatches

While we encourage teams to utilize Spectrum design as it is, we do realize that sometimes product specific
customizations may be needed. In these cases, we encourage you or your designers to **talk to us**.
We may be able to suggest an alternative implementation strategy, or perhaps your design can help inform future
Spectrum additions.

While the traditional `className` and `style` props are not supported in React Spectrum components, there are two
escape hatches that you can **use at your own risk**. These are `UNSAFE_className` and `UNSAFE_style`. Use of these props
should be considered a **last resort**. They can be used to work around bugs or limitations in React Spectrum,
but should not be used in the long term.

The reasoning behind this is that future updates to Spectrum design may cause unintended breaking changes in products.
If the internal DOM structure or CSS properties of a React Spectrum component change, this may lead to conflicts with CSS
overrides in products. For this reason, `className` and `style` are unsafe, and if you use them know that you are doing so at
your own risk.
