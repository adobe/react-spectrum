# Getting Started

This page describes how to get started building your own component library with React Aria.

## What is React Aria?

**React Aria** is a library of [React Hooks](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) that provides
accessible UI primitives for your design system. It provides [accessibility](accessibility.html) and behavior for many common
UI components so you can focus on your unique design and styling. It implements [adaptive interactions](interactions.html)
to ensure the best experience possible for all users, including support for mouse, touch, keyboard, and
screen readers.

## Installation

React Aria is **incrementally adoptable**. Each component is published as a separate package, so you can try it
out in a single component and gradually add more over time. All of these packages are published under the
[@react-aria](https://www.npmjs.com/org/react-aria) scope on npm.

You can install any React Aria package using a package manager like [npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/npm) or
[yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/).

```
yarn add @react-aria/button
```

## Building a component

React Aria provides behavior and accessibility through React Hooks. Since **it does not provide any rendering**,
you are responsible for defining the DOM structure for your component and passing the DOM props returned by each
React Aria hook to the appropriate elements. This is powerful because it allows you to be in **complete control** over
the DOM structure that you render. For example, you may need to add extra elements for styling or layout control.
You also get complete control over how you style your components: you could use CSS classes, inline styles, CSS-in-JS, etc.

Start by importing the hook you wish to use, and calling it in your component. You'll typically pass through the props
from your component, along with a [ref](https://reactjs.org/docs/refs-and-the-dom.html) to the DOM node in some cases.
The hook will return one or more sets of DOM props which you should pass through to the appropriate element. This can be
done by [spreading the props](https://reactjs.org/docs/jsx-in-depth.html#spread-attributes) returned from the hook onto
the element that you render.

This example shows a very simple button component built with the [useButton](useButton.html) hook.

```tsx example
import {useButton} from '@react-aria/button';

function Button(props) {
  let ref = React.useRef();
  let {buttonProps} = useButton(props, ref);

  return (
    <button {...buttonProps} ref={ref}>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
}

<Button onPress={() => alert('Button pressed!')}>
  Press me
</Button>
```

Now you just need to add your own styling, and you have a fully accessible button component that works consistently
across mouse, touch, keyboard, and screen readers! See the [useButton](useButton.html) docs for an example of how to do that.

## Stateful components

Many components are **stateless** — they display information to a user. Examples of stateless components include buttons,
progress bars, and links. These components don't update as the user interacts when them.

A **stateful** component has some state, and allows a user to interact with the component in order to update that state.
Examples of stateful components include text fields, checkboxes, and selects.

React Aria separates the state management logic into a separate hook that lives in [react-stately](../react-stately/index.html).
The state hook holds the state for the component, and provides an interface to read and update that state. This allows
this logic to be reused across different platforms, e.g. in react-native. Read more about this on the
[architecture](../architecture.html) page.

To build a stateful component, you'll need to install and import the corresponding state hook from react-stately.
Then, call the state hook from your component, and pass the resulting state object to the React Aria hook.
You can also use the state in your rendering code to determine what visual state to display.

This example shows a very simple checkbox component built with the [useCheckbox](useCheckbox.html) hook, along
with [useToggleState](../react-stately/useToggleState.html) hook from react-stately.

```tsx example
import {useToggleState} from '@react-stately/toggle';
import {useCheckbox} from '@react-aria/checkbox';

function Checkbox(props) {
  let state = useToggleState(props);
  let ref = React.useRef();
  let {inputProps} = useCheckbox(props, state, ref);

  return (
    <label style={{display: 'block'}}>
      <input {...inputProps} ref={ref} />
      {props.children}
    </label>
  );
}

<Checkbox onChange={isChecked => alert(isChecked ? 'Checked!' : 'Unchecked')}>
  Check me
</Checkbox>
```

See the [useCheckbox](useCheckbox.html) docs for a full example of a custom styled checkbox.

## Next steps

Now that you understand how to use the hooks in React Aria to build your own components, you can read the documentation
for the individual hooks to understand them in detail. We also have high level documentation about topics like
[interactions](interactions.html), [internationalization](internationalization.html), and [accessibility](accessibility.html).

For a complete example of a component library built with React Aria, check out [React Spectrum](../react-spectrum/index.html),
which is an implementation of [Spectrum](https://spectrum.adobe.com/), Adobe's design system.
The [source code](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/tree/master/packages/%40react-spectrum) is a good
example of how the React Aria hooks are used in many real world components.
