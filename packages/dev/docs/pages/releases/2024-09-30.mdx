description: Happy fall! We’re excited to announce that our color picker components are now generally available! This includes ColorPicker, ColorArea, ColorField, ColorSlider, ColorSwatch, ColorSwatchPicker, and ColorWheel. These enable you to build fully customizable color pickers, including accessible color descriptions for screen reader support.
In addition, we’ve introduced a new pending state for buttons in React Aria Components, allowing you to display a progress spinner to indicate that an action is in progress. It also handles screen reader announcements and disables other interactions, except for focus, during the pending state.
We're also advancing the React Aria Components Tree and Spectrum TreeView to beta, and have added some basic documentation. In alpha, we have new Disclosure and DisclosureGroup components in React Aria Components, which can be used to build accordions and other collapsible panels.
