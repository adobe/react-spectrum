# October 2, 2025 Release

Happy fall! This release brings some long-awaited features, including multi-selection in [React Aria Select](../react-aria/Select.html#multiple-selection) and enhanced animation support across our components. For example, [Disclosure](../react-aria/Disclosure.html) now provides CSS variables to easily animate expanding and collapsing. We’ve also added a new `<SelectionIndicator>` component that can be used within components that support single selection such as [Tabs](../react-aria/Tabs.html) and [ToggleButtonGroup](../react-aria/ToggleButtonGroup.html#animation) to animate selection changes. In addition, we have significantly improved the behavior of scrolling modals on iOS 26. Lastly, `onAction` can now be used on a [`ComboBoxItem`](../react-aria/ComboBox.html#item-actions), enabling you to add a “create” option.


### Multi-Selection in React Aria Select:
To support multi-selection in React Aria Select, we are updating the API from `selectedKey` to  `value`, matching the React `select` API. The deprecated API is supported for backward compatibility, but only supports single selection. Please see our [docs](../react-aria/Select.html#multiple-selection) for more on how to implement multi-selection.
