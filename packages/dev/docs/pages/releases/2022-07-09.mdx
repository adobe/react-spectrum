# July 29, 2022 Release

In this release, we focused on improvements to bundle size and developer experience. These include tree shaking improvements, large dependency removal, API simplification, TypeScript improvements, and a big documentation overhaul. And as always, we also have lots of bug fixes for our existing components.

## Developer experience

Based on feedback from the community, we have been working on a number of developer experience improvements for React Aria. We have updated many of our older hooks to follow our newer API conventions which reduce boilerplate and details you need to worry about. We have added states such as `isPressed`, `isSelected`, and `isDisabled` to the return values of many hooks, which can be used for styling purposes. We have also reduced the number of hooks you need to call, and the number of arguments you need to manually pass between them.

We have added a number of improvements to the React Aria documentation. There are new styled examples in CodeSandbox for several of our hooks, which demonstrate various styling libraries and techniques such as Tailwind CSS, Styled Components, CSS modules, and more. We have also added a “Usage” section to all of our docs, which includes various examples showing the features and options of components built with our hooks. Finally, all React Aria examples now use the `react-aria` and `react-stately` mono packages rather than individual component packages, which reduces the number of npm packages you need to install and manage.

We have also improved the TypeScript experience in this release. All of our packages, including both individual packages and mono packages (e.g. `@adobe/react-spectrum`, `react-aria`, and `react-stately`), now export all of their types. This allows you to use them in your own components, without installing extra packages. In addition, all of our return types now support both HTML and SVG elements.

More TypeScript and developer experience improvements will be coming in future updates!

## Bundle size

In the bundle size department, we have improved our tree shaking support so that only the hooks and components you use in your app will be included. In addition, we have removed the large `intl-messageformat` dependency, which was used to format localized strings used for screen reader messages. This has been replaced by a new compiler, which parses the messages during our build, and generates normal JavaScript template string literals, so that a parser is not needed at runtime. Finally, we’ve removed the `dom-helpers` dependency, which was no longer needed.

These changes combine to significantly reduce the average bundle size for our components. For example, a date picker is now ~67 KB smaller minified (~22 KB smaller with gzip).

As always, thanks to everyone who contributed!
