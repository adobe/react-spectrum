# April 14, 2025 Release

In todayâ€™s release, we are excited to announce custom calendar support across all React Spectrum libraries! This feature allows you to create your own calendar that implements custom business logic, such as a [4-5-4 fiscal calendar](https://nrf.com/resources/4-5-4-calendar), either by extending an existing Calendar implementation or building from scratch. Please see the [React Spectrum docs](../react-spectrum/Calendar.html#custom-calendar-systems) for an example implementation. A special shout out to [@ToyWalrus](https://github.com/ToyWalrus) for all the hard work that went into this contribution!

This release also include several updates for collections in React Aria Components. These include enhanced support for React Suspense and optimizations for large collections. These changes should result in much more performant collections when fetching and rendering large amounts of data.

We have also reduced the bundle sizes of our libraries by moving some console warnings to development only, and removing old browser fallbacks for pointer events. For example, `@react-aria/interactions`, which powers most of our components, is now 22% smaller!

Lastly, we have decided to handle `onClick` as an alias for `onPress`. This improves interoperability with other dependencies that use `onClick` events. Please note that `onPress` is still preferred over `onClick` as it standardizes behavior across a variety of platforms.

A huge thank you once again to everyone in the community for all of your feedback and contributions!
