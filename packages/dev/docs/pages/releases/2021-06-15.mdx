# June 15, 2021 Release

Today we're excited to announce the stable release of Tabs! ðŸŽ‰ [React Aria](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/useTabList.html) includes hooks for you to build your own tabs that are fully accessible and keyboard friendly, and [React Spectrum](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/Tabs.html) includes some advanced behaviors like automatic collapsing when screen space is limited.

Also in this release, React Spectrum's ActionGroup component has gained support for collapsing items that do not fit in the available space. In addition, the text labels of the buttons within an ActionGroup can now be hidden, and automatically displayed in a tooltip. See our [documentation](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/ActionGroup.html#collapsing-behavior) for more details about this behavior.

[ActionGroup](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/ActionGroup.html#static-color), [ActionButton](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/ActionButton.html#static-color), and [ToggleButton](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/ToggleButton.html#static-color) now also support a `staticColor` prop, which allows these components to be placed over a color background.

Finally, thanks to [@so99ynoodles](https://github.com/so99ynoodles) and [@tomsontom](https://github.com/tomsontom), React Spectrum's style props have been upgraded, including support for [responsive breakpoints](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/layout.html#responsive-layout) and [CSS functions](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/styling.html#css-functions) like `calc()`.

Thank you to all our contributors for their support! ðŸ¤©
