        <DisclosurePanel>
          This indicates that your <code>style</code> macro has a condition that isn't evaluable at build time. This can happen for a variety of reasons such
          as if you've referenced non-constant variables within your <code>style</code> macro or if you've called non-macro functions within your <code>style</code> macro.
          If you are using Typescript, it can be as simple as forgetting to add <code>as const</code> to your own defined reusable macro.

        <DisclosureTitle>I'm seeing a ton of duplicate rules being generated and/or my dev tools are very slow.</DisclosureTitle>

        <DisclosureTitle>I tried to pass my style macro to "UNSAFE_className" but it doesn't work.</DisclosureTitle>
        <DisclosurePanel>
          The <code>style</code> macro is not meant to be used with <code>UNSAFE_className</code>. Overrides to the Spectrum styles is highly discouraged,
          consider styling an equivalent React Aria Component instead.

        <DisclosureTitle>I'm coming from S1, but where are Flex/Grid/etc?</DisclosureTitle>
        <DisclosurePanel>
          These no longer exist. Please style <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code>, and other standard HTML elements with the <code>style</code> macro instead.
