# SSRProvider

## Introduction

If you're using React 16 or 17, `SSRProvider` should be used as a wrapper for the entire application during server side rendering.
It works together with the [useId](useId.html) hook to ensure that auto generated ids are consistent
between the client and server by resetting the id internal counter on each request.
See the [server side rendering](ssr.html) docs for more information.

**Note**: if you're using React 18 or newer, `SSRProvider` is not necessary and can be removed from your app. React Aria uses the
[React.useId](https://react.dev/reference/react/useId) hook internally when using React 18, which ensures ids are consistent.

## Example

```tsx
import {SSRProvider} from '@react-aria/ssr';

<SSRProvider>
  <YourApp />
</SSRProvider>
```
