# useFocusWithin

## API

<FunctionAPI function={docs.exports.useFocusWithin} links={docs.links} />

## Features

`useFocusWithin` handles focus interactions for an element and its descendants. Focus is "within"
an element when either the element itself or a descendant element has focus. This is similar to
the [:focus-within](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/:focus-within) pseudo class
in CSS.

To handle focus events on only the target element, and not descendants, see [useFocus](useFocus.html).

## Usage

`useFocusWithin` returns props that you should spread onto the target element:

<GroupedPropTable {...docs.exports.FocusWithinResult} links={docs.links} />

`useFocusWithin` supports the following event handlers:

<GroupedPropTable {...docs.exports.FocusWithinProps} links={docs.links} defaultExpanded={new Set(['Events'])}/>


## Example

This example shows two text fields inside a div, which handles focus within events. It stores focus
within state in local component state, which is updated by an `onFocusWithinChange` handler. This is used
to update the background color and text color of the group while one of the text fields has focus.

Focus within and blur within events are also logged to the list below. Notice that the events are only
fired when the wrapper gains and loses focus, not when focus moves within the group.

{/* We don't have component hook docs yet */}
{/* **NOTE: for more advanced text field functionality, see [useTextField](useTextField.html).** */}

```tsx render
"use client";
import React from 'react';
import {useFocusWithin} from '@react-aria/interactions';

function Example() {
  let [events, setEvents] = React.useState([]);
  let [isFocusWithin, setFocusWithin] = React.useState(false);
  let {focusWithinProps} = useFocusWithin({
    onFocusWithin: e => setEvents(
      events => [...events, 'focus within']
    ),
    onBlurWithin: e => setEvents(
      events => [...events, 'blur within']
    ),
    onFocusWithinChange: isFocusWithin => setFocusWithin(isFocusWithin)
  });

  return (
    <>
      <div
        {...focusWithinProps}
        style={{
          display: 'inline-block',
          border: '1px solid gray',
          padding: 10,
          background: isFocusWithin ? 'goldenrod' : '',
          color: isFocusWithin ? 'black' : ''
        }}>
        <label style={{display: 'block'}}>
          First Name: <input />
        </label>
        <label style={{display: 'block'}}>
          Last Name: <input />
        </label>
      </div>
      <ul
        style={{
          maxHeight: '200px',
          overflow: 'auto'
        }}>
        {events.map((e, i) => <li key={i}>{e}</li>)}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}
```
