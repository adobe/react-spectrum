# Welcome!

The React Spectrum docs have a new look! This is a **beta preview** so keep in mind that we will be continuing to make improvements before the full release.

<LinkButton href="s2/getting-started.html" variant="accent" size="L">Get Started with Spectrum 2</LinkButton>

## What's new?

- Docs for [Spectrum 2](https://s2.spectrum.adobe.com) components
- New docs for [React Aria](react-aria/Autocomplete.html) and [Internationalized](internationalized/date/index.html)
- A new search menu experience
- Interactive controls for examples
- New concept guides
- AI-friendly markdown docs
- Much more...

## Roadmap

The existing docs are still available [here](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-spectrum/index.html). We plan to do a full release of the new docs site by early 2026, so we welcome any and all feedback!
