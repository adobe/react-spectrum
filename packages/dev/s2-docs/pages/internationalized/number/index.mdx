## Introduction

Numbers are represented in many different ways by cultures around the world. This includes differences in currency symbols, units, decimal points, grouping separators, and even digits themselves. When building applications that support users around the world, it is important to handle these aspects correctly for each locale. The `@internationalized/number` package provides a utilities to format and parse numbers according to locale expectations.

This example parses a percentage in the Arabic numbering system according to the `ar-SA` locale, and formats as a Latin number in the `en-US` locale.

```tsx
import {NumberParser, NumberFormatter} from '@internationalized/number';

let parser = new NumberParser('ar-SA', {style: 'percent'});
let number = parser.parse('٤٥٪'); // 0.45

let formatter = new NumberFormatter('en-US', {style: 'percent'});
formatter.format(number); // '45%'
```

See the docs for [NumberParser](NumberParser.html) and [NumberFormatter](NumberFormatter.html) to learn more.
