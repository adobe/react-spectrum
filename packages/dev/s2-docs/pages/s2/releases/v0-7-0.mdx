# v0.7.0

Version 0.7.0 introduces the TreeView component and includes important CSS updates to fix Safari issues. This release removes all: revert-layer from the style macro and includes Badge improvements, Tabs collapse behavior, and updated codemods.

## Important CSS update

In this release, we have made significant changes to the way our Style Macro generates CSS in order to fix issues with Safari. The Style Macro uses [CSS Cascade Layers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn_web_development/Core/Styling_basics/Cascade_layers) to avoid CSS specificity and ordering issues. However, this means global CSS declared outside a `@layer`, such as CSS resets, will take precedence over S2's CSS. To avoid this, we previously used [all: revert-layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/revert-layer). Unfortunately, due to numerous bugs in Safari 18, this caused rendering issues in our components.

To fix these Safari issues, we have removed `all: revert-layer` in this release. This means that global CSS will now take precedence over S2's styles. **If you are using a CSS reset on the same page as S2 components, you will need to remove it** or put it in a `@layer` of its own. See the [Intro](../index.html#css-resets) for more information.

**If you are using a version older than React Spectrum v3 on the same page, you must update to the latest version.** See the Adobe internal documentation for more details.
