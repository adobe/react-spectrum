# v0.10.0
<Time date={date} />

Version 0.10.0 introduces a new font for Spectrum 2: Adobe Clean Spectrum VF, along with new date and time components including Calendar, DatePicker, DateRangePicker, and TimeField. This release also includes various component improvements and bug fixes.

## Font update

This release introduces a new font for Spectrum 2: Adobe Clean Spectrum VF. This is an evolution of the previous Adobe Clean, with slightly updated metrics allowing for better vertical centering. Along with this update, the S2 Provider component now automatically handles loading the fonts needed for the user's language. The new font does not affect previous versions of React Spectrum.

If you previously used `page.css` without a `Provider`, you'll need to add a `Provider` around your app to load the fonts. See the [Intro](../index.html#setting-up-your-app) for details.
