# v0.1.0
<Time date={date} />

Version 0.1.0 introduces the first version of Spectrum 2, including new Badge, ComboBox, Meter, and Picker components.

## New components
* [Badge](?path=/docs/badge--docs)
* [ComboBox](?path=/docs/combobox--docs)
* [Meter](?path=/docs/meter--docs)
* [Picker](?path=/docs/picker--docs)

## Updates
* [TagGroup](?path=/docs/taggroup--docs) now supports avatars, images, error message and description help text, and improved hover/focus styling
* Updated React Aria Components to v1.2.0
* Fixed global styles such as CSS resets from applying to Spectrum 2 elements. Note that any CSS rule referenced from an `UNSAFE_className` prop must now be wrapped in `@layer UNSAFE_overrides`. See [the docs](?path=/docs/intro--docs#unsafe-style-overrides) for more details.
* The `style` macro will now error if it is called without importing `with {type: 'macro'}`. Previously it would fail to apply styles silently. This should help with debugging.

See the updated [API changelog](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/blob/main/packages/@react-spectrum/s2/api-diff.md) for a full list of changes since RSP v3.
