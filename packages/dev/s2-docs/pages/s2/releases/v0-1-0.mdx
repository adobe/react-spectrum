# v0.1.0

Version 0.1.0 introduces the first version of Spectrum 2, including new Badge, ComboBox, Meter, and Picker components.

## New components
* [Badge](../Badge)
* [ComboBox](../ComboBox)
* [Meter](../Meter)
* [Picker](../Picker)

## Updates
* [TagGroup](../TagGroup) now supports avatars, images, error message and description help text, and improved hover/focus styling
* Updated React Aria Components to v1.2.0
* Fixed global styles such as CSS resets from applying to Spectrum 2 elements. Note that any CSS rule referenced from an `UNSAFE_className` prop must now be wrapped in `@layer UNSAFE_overrides`.
* The `style` macro will now error if it is called without importing `with {type: 'macro'}`. Previously it would fail to apply styles silently. This should help with debugging.

See the updated [API changelog](../migrating) for a full list of changes since RSP v3.
