<Time date={date} />

Version 0.12.0 adds pending states to ActionButton, avatar support in ComboBox and Picker, Dialog XL size, and Popover styling improvements. This release also includes RTL fixes, placeholder support across components, and various component enhancements.

* [ActionButton](../ActionButton.html): Add pending state
* [ColorSlider](../ColorSlider.html): Fix `ColorLoupe` position in RTL locales
* [ComboBox](../ComboBox.html): Support avatars and onAction
* [CustomDialog](../Dialog.html#custom-dialog): Support custom widths

* [Disclosure](../Disclosure.html): Add animation to disclosure

* Allow placeholders in supported S2 components (e.g. ColorArea, ComboBox, NumberField, SearchField, TextArea, TextField)
* Apply `page.css` styles to the Shadow DOM

## Popover Styling Updates

The Popover component has been updated to better support custom styling. To
remove the preset padding, use the new `padding` prop and wrap your Popover content
in a custom div with your desired styling.
