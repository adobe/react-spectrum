# v0.8.0

Version 0.8.0 introduces NotificationBadge and Toast (alpha) components, along with updates to Disclosure design sizing. This release also includes various component improvements and new exports.

## New Components
* [NotificationBadge](../ActionButton)
* [Toast](../Toast) (alpha)

## Updates
* Pass DOM Props to ButtonGroup
* Prevent Dividers from growing or shrinking in a flex container by default
* Export Autocomplete
* Export SortDescriptor type

## Disclosure Design updates
Spectrum has updated the S disclosure design. As a result, all other sizes (M, L, XL) now map to one size smaller than before. See [PR](https://github.com/adobe/react-spectrum/pull/8006) for details.
