# v1.1.0

It’s our first release of the new year and we’ve got plenty of exciting treats we’re bringing to the table. We’ve added a variety of new features to our documentation site including a new dark/light mode switch in the site header. Our search menu also now features a Colors section where you can browse the Spectrum-defined colors and search by name or hex value to find close or exact matches. We also now offer our docs in the form of [Agent Skills](../ai#agent-skills) that can be installed locally and used by your favorite AI coding tools.

This release also includes several bugs fixes, such as properly rendering menus when rendered from within a popover and updates to TreeView disabledBehavior styling to match the latest designs. 

Thank you for all of your feedback on 1.0 and stay tuned for more updates and enhancements coming throughout the year!
