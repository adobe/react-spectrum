# style-macro-chrome-plugin

This is a chrome plugin to assist in debugging the styles applied by our Style Macro.

## Local development

From the root of our monopackage, run

```
yarn
yarn workspace style-macro-chrome-plugin start
```

This will create a dist directory in the directory `packages/dev/style-macro-chrome-plugin` which will update anytime the code changes and results in a rebuild.

Next, open Chrome and go to [chrome://extensions/](chrome://extensions/).

Load an unpacked extension, it's a button in the top left, and navigate to the dist directory.

The extension is now registered in Chrome and you can go to storybook or docs, wherever you are working.

Inspect an element on the page to open dev tools and go to the Style Macro panel.

## Troubleshooting

If the panel isn't updating with styles, try closing the dev tools and reopening it.

If the extension doesn't appear to have the latest code, try closing the dev tools and reopening it.

If every tab you have open (or many of them) reload when you make local changes to the extension, then go into the extension settings and limit it to `localhost` or something appropriate.
