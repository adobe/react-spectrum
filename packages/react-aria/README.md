## Getting started

The easiest way to start building a component library with React Aria is by following our [getting started](https://react-spectrum.adobe.com/react-aria/hooks.html) guide. It walks through all of the steps needed to install the hooks from npm, and create your first component.

### Example

Here is a very basic example of using React Aria.

```jsx
import {useButton} from '@react-aria-nutrient/button';

function Button(props) {
  let ref = React.useRef();
  let {buttonProps} = useButton(props, ref);

  return (
    <button {...buttonProps} ref={ref}>
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
}

<Button onPress={() => alert('Button pressed!')}>Press me</Button>
```
