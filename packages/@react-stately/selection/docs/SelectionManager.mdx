## Introduction

A <TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.SelectionManager} /> provides a generic interface for reading and
updating selection and focus state based on a <TypeLink links={collectionsDocs.links} type={collectionsDocs.exports.Collection} />.
As discussed in the [selection introduction](selection.html), a selection is represented
by a [Set](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Set) of item keys. Focus
is represented by a single item key.

Focus state is updated when navigating a collection with the keyboard. Selection state is updated when a user
clicks or taps an item, or uses the keyboard to select an item. These interactions are handled by
the <TypeLink links={ariaDocs.links} type={ariaDocs.exports.useSelectableCollection} /> hook in [react-aria](/react-aria/index.html).

A `SelectionManager` wraps the state returned by <TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.useMultipleSelectionState} />.
Oftentimes, you won't need to construct these directly because hooks like <TypeLink links={listDocs.links} type={listDocs.exports.useListState} />
and <TypeLink links={treeDocs.links} type={treeDocs.exports.useTreeState} /> already handle this and return
a `SelectionManager` for you.

## Interface

<ClassAPI links={docs.links} class={docs.exports.SelectionManager} />
