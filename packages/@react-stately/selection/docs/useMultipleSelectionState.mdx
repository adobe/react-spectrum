## Introduction

`useMultipleSelectionState` manages selection state for many components. Oftentimes, you won't
need to use this hook directly, since it's included in hooks
like <TypeLink links={listDocs.links} type={listDocs.exports.useListState} />,
and <TypeLink links={selectDocs.links} type={selectDocs.exports.useSelectState} />.
These expose a [SelectionManager](SelectionManager.html), which provides a higher level way
to manipulate selection state.

## API

<FunctionAPI links={docs.links} function={docs.exports.useMultipleSelectionState} />

## Interface

<ClassAPI links={docs.links} class={docs.links[docs.exports.useMultipleSelectionState.return.id]} />
