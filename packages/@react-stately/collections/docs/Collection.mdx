# Collection interface

<PageDescription>{collectionsDocs.exports.Collection.description}</PageDescription>

## Introduction

The <TypeLink links={collectionsDocs.links} type={collectionsDocs.exports.Collection} /> interface provides a generic representation
for many types of collections. The collection is read only (immutable), and sequential (ordered). Each item
has a unique key that identifies it, which can be used to access items. It's like a combination
of an array and a map: you can iterate over items in a well defined order, and also access items by key.

## Interface

<ClassAPI links={collectionsDocs.links} class={collectionsDocs.exports.Collection} />

## Building a collection

The <TypeLink links={collectionsDocs.links} type={collectionsDocs.exports.Collection} /> interface can be implemented in many ways.
For example, you could write a class to expose the required methods and properties for an underlying data structure
like an array or [Map](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Map).

As discussed on the [Collection Components](collections.html) page, React Spectrum implements a JSX-based
API for defining collections. This is implemented by the <TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.useCollection} />
hook. `useCollection` iterates over the JSX tree, and recursively builds a collection
of <TypeLink links={collectionsDocs.links} type={collectionsDocs.exports.Node} /> objects. Each node includes the value of the item
it represents, along with some metadata about its place in the collection.

These nodes are then wrapped in a class that implements the <TypeLink links={collectionsDocs.links} type={collectionsDocs.exports.Collection} />
interface, and exposes the nodes. State management hooks like <TypeLink links={listDocs.links} type={listDocs.exports.useListState} />
and <TypeLink links={treeDocs.links} type={treeDocs.exports.useTreeState} /> handle building the collection and exposing
the necessary interface to components.

When implementing collection components using [react-aria](/react-aria/index.html) hooks
like <TypeLink links={listboxDocs.links} type={listboxDocs.exports.useListBox} />,
and <TypeLink links={selectDocs.links} type={selectDocs.exports.useSelect} />, you'll iterate over these nodes
to render the data in the collection. The properties exposed by a node are described below.

## Node interface

<TypeContext.Provider value={collectionsDocs.links}>
  <InterfaceType properties={collectionsDocs.exports.Node.properties} />
</TypeContext.Provider>
