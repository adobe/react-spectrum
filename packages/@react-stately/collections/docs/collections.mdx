# Collection components

Many components display a collection of items, and provide functionality such as keyboard
navigation, selection, and more. React Spectrum has a unified API to define the items
displayed in these components.

## Introduction

There are many components that display a collection of items of some kind. For example, lists, menus, selects,
tables, trees, and grids. These collections can usually be navigated with the keyboard using arrow keys, and
many have some form of selection. Many support loading data asynchronously, updating that data over time,
virtualized scrolling for performance with large collections, and more.

There are many ways one could design an API for components like this: JSX children, a
list of option objects, or a datasource object. Selection, and
other states like disabled, could be passed in to each item, or as a top-level prop.
Each of these has various tradeoffs. This page describes how we do it in React Spectrum, and covers some
of these tradeoffs in detail.

## Design goals

Our main design goal was to provide a consistent API across many types of collection components that is
easy to learn, performant on large collections, and extensible for advanced features. Some of the use-cases
we considered were:

- Static data
- Dynamic data
- Async loading
- Sections/groups of data from a single source
- Sections from different sources
- Single and multiple selection (controlled and uncontrolled)
- Controlled and uncontrolled expanded states for components like trees and accordions
- Marking items as selected, expanded, disabled, etc. prior to loading them from a server
- Drag and drop of items
- Virtualization for large collections
- Infinite scrolling to load more items on demand

## Static collections

React Spectrum implements a JSX-based API for defining collections. This allows an intuitive way to provide
items, which can contain rich rendering, and various options as props. Building hierarchical
collections, e.g. sections, or a tree of items is also very natural in JSX.

A **static collection** is a collection that does not change over time (e.g. hard coded). This is common for
components like action menus where the items are built into the application rather than representing user data.

A simple static collection could be constructed as in the following example.

```tsx
<Menu>
  <Item>Open</Item>
  <Item>Edit</Item>
  <Item>Delete</Item>
</Menu>
```

### Sections

Sections or groups of items can be constructed by wrapping the items as needed.

```tsx
<ListBox>
  <Section title="People">
    <Item>David</Item>
    <Item>Sam</Item>
    <Item>Jane</Item>
  </Section>
  <Section title="Animals">
    <Item>Aardvark</Item>
    <Item>Kangaroo</Item>
    <Item>Snake</Item>
  </Section>
</ListBox>
```

The &lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Item} />&gt; and
&lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Section} />&gt; components
are shared between many collection components. This ensures that they have a consistent
interface that can be learned once and applied everywhere.

&lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Item} />&gt; and
&lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Section} />&gt; only define the data for
the items and sections, not the rendering, visual appearance, or behavior. This is up to
the individual collection component (e.g. Menu or ListBox) to implement.

## Dynamic collections

Static collections are great when the items never change, but how about dynamic data? A **dynamic collection**
is a collection that is based on data, for example from an API. In addition, it may change over time as
items are added, updated, or removed from the collection by a user.

React Spectrum implements a JSX-based interface for dynamic collections, which maps over your data and
applies a function for each item to render it. The following example shows how a collection can be
rendered based on dynamic data, stored in React state.

```tsx
let [animals, setAnimals] = useState([
  {id: 1, name: 'Aardvark'},
  {id: 2, name: 'Kangaroo'},
  {id: 3, name: 'Snake'}
]);

<ListBox items={animals}>
  {item => <Item>{item.name}</Item>}
</ListBox>
```

As you can see, the items are passed to the `items` prop of the top-level component, which iterates over each
item and calls the function passed as children to the component. The item object is passed to the function, which
returns an &lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Item} />&gt;.

### Unique keys

All items in a collection must have a unique key or id, which is used to determine what items in the collection changed
when updates occur. By default, React Spectrum looks for an `id` or `key` property on each item, which is often returned
from a database. You can also specify a custom key on each item using the `key` prop. For example, if all animals in the
example had a unique `name` property, then each item's `key` could be set to `item.name` to use it as the unique key.

```tsx
let [animals, setAnimals] = useState([
  {name: 'Aardvark'},
  {name: 'Kangaroo'},
  {name: 'Snake'}
]);

<ListBox items={animals}>
  {item => <Item key={item.name}>{item.name}</Item>}
</ListBox>
```

Note that if you do specify a custom key on each `Item` using the `key` prop, React will convert the provided key to a string. As a result,
all the collection component's key related event handlers and props (e.g. `onSelectionChange`, `selectedKey(s)`) will expect and return strings.
If you forgo specifying a key on the `Item` and instead rely on the id or key being defined in your `items` array, the key related event handlers and props
will match what you have in your `items` array. See the [Selection](./selection.html#selected-key-data-type) docs for more info.

### Why not array map?

You may be wondering why we didn't use `animals.map` in this example.
In fact, you can do this if you want and it will work, but it will not be as performant.

```tsx
let [animals, setAnimals] = useState([
  {name: 'Aardvark'},
  {name: 'Kangaroo'},
  {name: 'Snake'}
]);

<ListBox>
  {animals.map(item =>
    <Item key={item.name}>{item.name}</Item>
  )}
</ListBox>
```

Using the `items` prop and providing a render function allows React Spectrum to automatically cache the results
of rendering each item and avoid re-rendering all items in the collection when only one of them changes. This
has big performance benefits for large collections.

### Updating data

When you need to update the data to add, remove, or change an item, you can do so using a standard React state update.

**IMPORTANT: all items passed to a collection component must be immutable. Changing a property on an item, or calling
`array.push()` or other mutating methods will not work as expected.**

The <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useListData} /> hook can be used to manage the
data and state for a list of items, and update it over time. It will also handle removing items from the selection
state when they are removed from the list. See the [useListBox docs](../react-aria/useListBox.html) for more details.

The following example shows how you might append a new item to the list.

```tsx
import {useListData} from '@react-stately/data';

let list = useListData({
  initialItems: [
    {name: 'Aardvark'},
    {name: 'Kangaroo'},
    {name: 'Snake'}
  ],
  initialSelectedKeys: ['Kangaroo'],
  getKey: item => item.name
});

function addAnimal(name) {
  list.append({name});
}

<ListBox items={list.items}>
  {item => <Item key={item.name}>{item.name}</Item>}
</ListBox>
```

### Sections

Sections can be built by returning a &lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Section} />&gt; instead of
an &lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Item} />&gt; item from the top-level item renderer. Sections
also support an `items` prop and a renderer function for their children.

```tsx
let [sections, setSections] = useState([
  {
    name: 'People',
    items: [
      {name: 'David'},
      {name: 'Same'},
      {name: 'Jane'}
    ]
  },
  {
    name: 'Animals',
    items: [
      {name: 'Aardvark'},
      {name: 'Kangaroo'},
      {name: 'Snake'}
    ]
  }
]);

<Picker items={sections}>
  {section =>
    <Section key={section.name} title={section.name} items={section.items}>
      {item => <Item key={item.name}>{item.name}</Item>}
    </Section>
  }
</Picker>
```

When updating nested data, be sure that all parent items change accordingly. Items are immutable,
so don't use mutating methods like push, or replace a property on a parent item. Instead, copy
the items that changed as needed.

The <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useTreeData} /> hook can be used to
manage data and state for a tree of items. This is similar to `useListData`, but with support for
hierarchical data. Like `useListData`, `useTreeData` will also handle automatically
removing items from the selection when they are removed from the list. See the
[useTreeData docs](useTreeData.html) for more details.

```tsx
import {useTreeData} from '@react-stately/data';

let tree = useTreeData({
  initialItems: [
    {
      name: 'People',
      items: [
        {name: 'David'},
        {name: 'Sam'},
        {name: 'Jane'}
      ]
    },
    {
      name: 'Animals',
      items: [
        {name: 'Aardvark'},
        {name: 'Kangaroo'},
        {name: 'Snake'}
      ]
    }
  ],
  getKey: item => item.name,
  getChildren: item => item.items
});

function addPerson(name) {
  tree.append('People', {name});
}

<ListBox items={tree.items}>
  {node =>
    <Section title={node.value.name} items={node.children}>
      {node => <Item>{node.value.name}</Item>}
    </Section>
  }
</ListBox>
```

{/*

## Hierarchical data

Sections only allow a single level of hierarchy. Some components like trees allow arbitrary hierarchical
data of any depth to be displayed. This can be accomplished by nesting
&lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Item} />&gt; components, and using the `title` prop
to specify the contents of items with children.

```tsx
<Tree>
  <Item title="Animals">
    <Item>Aardvark</Item>
    <Item>Kangaroo</Item>
    <Item>Snake</Item>
  </Item>
  <Item title="People">
    <Item>Danni</Item>
    <Item>Devon</Item>
    <Item>Ross</Item>
  </Item>
</Tree>
```

To support dynamic data, &lt;<TypeLink links={docs.links} type={docs.exports.Item} />&gt; supports a
`childItems` prop, which causes your item renderer function to be called recursively for each child.

```tsx
let [items, setItems] = useState([
  {name: 'Animals', children: [
    {name: 'Aardvark'},
    {name: 'Kangaroo'},
    {name: 'Snake'}
  ]},
  {name: 'People', children: [
    {name: 'Danni'},
    {name: 'Devon'},
    {name: 'Ross'}
  ]}
]);

<Tree items={items}>
  {item =>
    <Item key={item.name} childItems={item.children}>{item.name}</Item>
  }
</Tree>
```

*/}

## Asynchronous loading

Many collection components support loading data asynchronously. This is supported by passing an `isLoading` prop,
which is `true` while the data is loading. Once the data is loaded, `isLoading` should be set to `false`, and the
`items` prop should be set to the loaded data.

The <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useAsyncList} /> hook from `@react-stately/data` can be
used to manage async data loading from an API. Pass a `load` function to `useAsyncList`, which returns the items
to render. You can use whatever data fetching library you want, or the built-in
[fetch](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) API.

This example fetches a list of Pokemon from an API and displays them in a Picker.

```tsx
import {useAsyncList} from '@react-stately/data';

let list = useAsyncList({
  async load({signal}) {
    let res = await fetch('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon', {signal});
    let json = await res.json();
    return {items: json.results};
  }
});

<Picker
  label="Pick a Pokemon"
  items={list.items}
  isLoading={list.isLoading}>
  {item => <Item key={item.name}>{item.name}</Item>}
</Picker>
```

### Infinite loading

The <TypeLink links={dataDocs.links} type={dataDocs.exports.useAsyncList} /> hook also supports paginated data,
which is common in many APIs to avoid loading too many items at once. This is accomplished by returning a `cursor`
in addition to `items` from the `load` function. When the `loadMore` method is called, the cursor is passed back to your
`load` function, which you can use to determine the URL for the next page. The `onLoadMore` prop supported by many
collection components notifies you when you should load more data as the user scrolls.

This example expands on the previous one to support infinite scrolling through all known Pokemon.

```tsx
import {useAsyncList} from '@react-stately/data';

let list = useAsyncList({
  async load({signal, cursor}) {
    // If no cursor is available, then we're loading the first page.
    // Otherwise, the cursor is the next URL to load, as returned from the previous page.
    let res = await fetch(cursor || 'https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon', {signal});
    let json = await res.json();
    return {
      items: json.results,
      cursor: json.next
    };
  }
});

<Picker
  label="Pick a Pokemon"
  items={list.items}
  isLoading={list.isLoading}
  onLoadMore={list.loadMore}>
  {item => <Item key={item.name}>{item.name}</Item>}
</Picker>
```

{/*

### Sections with separate data sources

TODO

```tsx
<Tree>
  <Section
    title="Local Files"
    items={local.items}
    isLoading={local.isLoading}>
    {item => <Item>{item.name}</Item>}
  </Section>
  <Section
    title="In the Cloud"
    items={cloud.items}
    isLoading={cloud.isLoading}>
    {item => <Item>{item.name}</Item>}
  </Section>
</Tree>
```
