# Header

<p>{docs.exports.Header.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Header']} />

## Examples

```tsx example
<Header>Terms and Conditions</Header>
```

## Content

The Header component is used as a child to other
components providing formatting and semantic meaning as explained in
[Dialog](Dialog.html#content). It is
important to note that the Header element
accepts any renderable node, not just strings.

A Header is used to specify a layout region providing supplemental title information above the
content section of a component. Example of usage [Dialog](Dialog.html#example).

See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/header) for more information.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Header} links={docs.links} />
