<HeaderInfo

  componentNames={['Footer']} />

## Examples

```tsx example
<Footer>&copy; All rights reserved.</Footer>
```

## Content

The Footer component is used as a child to other components. Based on the
component it is used within, it gets Spectrum styling and may have a preassigned
slot for positioning. By virtue of its name, the Keyboard component provides
semantic meaning in the context they are placed. An example of this is
explained in [Dialog](Dialog.html#content). It is important to note
that the Footer element accepts any renderable node, not just strings.

A Footer is used to specify a layout region below the content section of a component.
Example usage can be found in [Dialog](Dialog.html#example).

See [the MDN docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/footer) for more information.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Footer} links={docs.links} />
