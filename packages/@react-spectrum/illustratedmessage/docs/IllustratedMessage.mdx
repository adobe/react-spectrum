# IllustratedMessage

<p>{docs.exports.IllustratedMessage.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['IllustratedMessage']} />

## Example

```tsx example
import NotFound from '@spectrum-icons/illustrations/NotFound';

<IllustratedMessage>
  <NotFound />
  <Heading>No Results</Heading>
  <Content>Try another search</Content>
</IllustratedMessage>
```

## Content

An IllustratedMessage consists of three areas: an illustration, a title, and a body.
Each of these sections can be populated by providing the following components to your IllustratedMessage as children:
`svg`, `Heading` (title), and `Content` (body).

```tsx example
import Upload from '@spectrum-icons/illustrations/Upload';

<IllustratedMessage>
  <Upload />
  <Heading>Drag and Drop Your File</Heading>
  <Content>Select a File from your computer<br /> or Search Adobe Stock</Content>
</IllustratedMessage>
```

### Accessibility

When an IllustratedMessage has a `svg` and a `Heading`, the `svg` needs an `aria-hidden` prop and a `role` prop set to `presentation`.

## Labeling

### Accessibility

The title of an IllustratedMessage is typically provided via its `Heading`.
If a `Heading` isn't specified, the illustration needs an `aria-label` prop to identify it to assistive technology.
If you pass an SVG in yourself, you'll need to ensure that the `role` prop is set to `img` as well.

```tsx example
<IllustratedMessage>
  <NotFound aria-label="No results" />
</IllustratedMessage>
```

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.IllustratedMessage} links={docs.links} />
