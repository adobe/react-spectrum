<HeaderInfo

  componentNames={['Switch']}
  sourceData={[{type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/switch/'}]} />

## Example

```tsx example
  <Switch>Switch it up</Switch>
```

## Content

Switches accept children, which are rendered as the label.

Switches are best used for communicating activation (e.g., on/off states), while [checkboxes](./Checkbox) are best used for communicating selection (e.g., multiple table rows).
Switches, unlike checkboxes, can't have an error state.

### Accessibility

In certain cases a visible label isn't needed. For example, a Switch located at the top of a panel which toggles the panels options on or off.
If a visible label isn't specified, an `aria-label` must be provided to the Switch for accessibility.
If the field is labeled by a separate element, an `aria-labelledby` prop must be provided using the id of the labeling element instead.

### Internationalization

To internationalize a Switch, a localized label should be passed to the `children` or `aria-label` prop.
For languages that are read right to left (e.g. Hebrew and Arabic), the layout of the switch is mirrored.

## Value

Switches are not selected by default. The `defaultSelected` prop can be used to set the default state (uncontrolled).
Alternatively, the `isSelected` prop can be used to make the selected state controlled.

```tsx example
<Switch defaultSelected>Uncontrolled</Switch>
<Switch isSelected>Controlled</Switch>
```

## Events

Switches accept a user defined `onChange` prop, triggered whenever the Switch is pressed.
The example below uses `onChange` to alert the user to changes in state.

```tsx example
function Example() {
  let [selected, setSelection] = React.useState('false');

  let toggle = (value) => {
    value ? setSelection('true') : setSelection('false');
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <div> The Switch is on: {selected} </div>
      <Switch onChange={toggle}>
        Switch Label
      </Switch>
    </div>
  );
 }
```
