## Example

```

## Content

The `Keyboard` component represents text that specifies a keyboard command,
which can be used within a Spectrum container such as a [Menu](Menu.html).
`Keyboard` provides no specific styling by itself, but receives styling
from the parent container. In addition, `Keyboard` will be automatically
placed within the container's layout according to Spectrum guidelines.

See [Menu](Menu.html#complex-menu-items) for examples of how to use the
`Keyboard` component in the context of a Spectrum container.
See [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/kbd) for more
information about the semantics of the `kbd` element.

## Props

<PropTable component={docs.exports.Keyboard} links={docs.links} />
