import {Layout} from '@react-spectrum/docs';
export default Layout;

import docs from 'docs:@react-spectrum/link';
import {HeaderInfo, PropTable} from '@react-spectrum/docs';
import packageData from '../package.json';

```jsx import
import {Link} from '@react-spectrum/link';
```

# Link

<p>{docs.exports.Link.description}</p>

<HeaderInfo
  packageData={packageData}
  componentNames={['Link']}
  sourceData={[{type: 'Spectrum', url: 'https://spectrum.adobe.com/page/link/'}]} />

## Example

```tsx example
<Link onPress={() => alert('pressed!')}>The missing link.</Link>
```

## Content

Links accept content as children.
If the content is plain text, it will be styled and exposed to assistive technologies as a link.
Events will need to be handled in JavaScript with the `onPress` prop.

```tsx example
<Link>A label</Link>
```

If the child is a native anchor element, or a link component used with a client side router, the Link component will add spectrum styles and event handlers to that element.
Actual navigation will be handled by the wrapped element.

```tsx example
<Link><a href="https://www.adobe.com" target="_blank">Adobe.com</a></Link>
```

To use in [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router/)

```tsx
import {Link} from '@react-spectrum/link';
import {Link as RouterLink} from 'react-router-dom';

<Link><RouterLink to="/next-page">Next Page</RouterLink></Link>
```

### Internationalization

In order to internationalize a link, a localized string should be passed to the `children` prop.

### Accessibility

For string-typed `children`, the link component will expose the acessible role to assistive technology as a "link".

```tsx example
<Link onPress={e => alert(`clicked "${e.target.textContent}" Link`)}>
  I forgot my password
</Link>
```

For other children, use an element of semantic meaning, or use a [role](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles) where appropriate.

Be mindful of what the experience is for users navigating with screen readers. Make sure to give enough context within the link about where the link will take the user.
