# Step 3: Add sub-headings

Within the Enhancements, Fixes, and Under Construction categories, group commits by UI component under sub-headings.

### Sub-heading rules:
- Use sub-headings ONLY for:
  - Enhancements
  - Fixes
  - Under Construction
- Do NOT create sub-headings for:
  - Documentation
  - To Be Categorized
  - S2
- Sub-headings should be in alphabetical order
- Use "Miscellaneous" as a sub-heading for commits that do not belong to a specific component
- Each category can have its own Miscellaneous sub-heading
- Write sub-headings and commits as unordered lists using a hyphen (-)
- Do NOT bold the sub-heading text
