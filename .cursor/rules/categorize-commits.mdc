# Step 1: Categorize commits 

Sort ALL commit messages into one of six main categories. The main categories are the following:
- Enhancements
- Fixes
- Documentation
- Under Construction
- To Be Categorized
- S2

Before categorizing commits into other groups, check whether each commit should be classified as “Under Construction.”
- Follow the steps below in order:
  1. Identify pre-release packages
    - Use a command such as grep to scan the repository for package versions that include prerelease identifiers (e.g., alpha, beta, rc)
  2. Extract component keywords from commit messages
    - Parse each commit message to identify possible component names
    - Normalize these keywords (e.g., lowercase, remove punctuation) for easier comparison.
  3. Compare extracted keywords with pre-release packages
    - If any keyword matches a package in the list, mark the commit as Under Construction.
  4. Check for explicit prerelease keywords in commit text
    - If the commit message directly includes alpha, beta, or rc, classify it as Under Construction, regardless of package matches.

Next, categorize the remaining commits not categorized as "Under Construction". Use the following keywords to determine the category:
| Keyword                    | Category |
|----------------------------|----------|
| feat                       | Enhancements|
| fix                        | Fixes |
| docs                       | Documentation |
| chore, revert, bump, build | To Be Categorized |
| S2                         | S2 |

Do not duplicate commits. In terms of priority, it should be Under Construction > S2 > To Be Categorized > Enhancements > Fixes > Documentation
